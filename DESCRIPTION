Description: An R package that lets you write SLiM scripts using your 
    favourite R IDE, using a syntax as cose as possible to the original 
    SLiM language. It offer many tools to manipulate those scripts, as well 
    as run them in the SLiM software from R, as well as capture and post-process
    their output, while simulations are running.
