The goal of slimr is to run SLiM population genetics forward simulations from R. It also has utilities for monitoring the simulations, and bringing the resulting data into R for post-processing and visualization.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rdinnager/slimr")
```

## Writing SLiM Scripts in R

Using `slimr`, this is how you write the first example script (or recipe) from the (excellent) [SLiM](https://messerlab.org/slim/) manual:

```{r recipe_1}
library(slimr)

slim_script(
  slim_block(initialize(),
             {
               ## set the overall mutation rate
               initializeMutationRate(1e-7); 
               ## m1 mutation type: neutral
               initializeMutationType("m1", 0.5, "f", 0.0);
               ## g1 genomic element type: uses m1 for all mutations
               initializeGenomicElementType("g1", m1, 1.0);
               ## uniform chromosome of length 100 kb
               initializeGenomicElement(g1, 0, 99999);
               ## uniform recombination along the chromosome
               initializeRecombinationRate(1e-8);
             }),
  slim_block(1,
             {
               sim.addSubpop("p1", 500);
             }),
  slim_block(10000,
             {
               sim.simulationFinished();
             })
) -> script_1

script_1
```

You can output this script to text to run in a standalone SLiM installation, or you can run it in SLiM directly from R, and many other things. Please see the package website for lots of examples (link in top right corner of github repo).

You can also do fancy stuff like make the above script or another script into a template that you can dynamically fill-in with parameters generated in R. You can also make SLiM generate R-friendly input. See the vignettes for details of these features and how to use them.
