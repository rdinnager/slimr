genomePedigreeID => (integer$)
If pedigree tracking is turned on with initializeSLiMOptions(keepPedigrees=T),
genomePedigreeID is a unique non-negative identifier for each genome in a simulation, never reused
throughout the duration of the simulation run. Furthermore, the genomePedigreeID of a given
genome will be equal to either (2*pedigreeID) or (2*pedigreeID + 1) of the individual that the
genome belongs to (the former for the first genome of the individual, the latter for the second genome
of the individual); this invariant relationship is guaranteed. This property is also available when treesequence
recording is enabled. If neither pedigree tracking nor tree-sequence recording is enabled,
this property is unavailable.
genomeType => (string$)
The type of chromosome represented by this genome; one of "A", "X", or "Y".
individual => (object<Individual>$)
The Individual object to which this genome belongs.
isNullGenome => (logical$)
T if the genome is a “null” genome, F if it is an ordinary genome object. When a sex chromosome (X
or Y) is simulated, the other sex chromosome also exists in the simulation, but it is a “null” genome
that does not carry any mutations. Instead, it is a placeholder, present to allow SLiM’s code to operate
in much the same way as it does when an autosome is simulated. Null genomes should not be
accessed or manipulated.
mutations => (object<Mutation>)
All of the Mutation objects present in this genome.
tag <–> (integer$)
A user-defined integer value. The value of tag is initially undefined, and it is an error to try to read
it; if you wish it to have a defined value, you must arrange that yourself by explicitly setting its value
prior to using it elsewhere in your code. The value of tag is not used by SLiM; it is free for you to use.
Note that the Genome objects used by SLiM are new with every generation, so the tag value of each
new offspring generated in each generation will be initially undefined. If you set a tag value for an
offspring genome inside a modifyChild() callback, that tag value will be preserved as the offspring
individual becomes a parent (across the generation boundary, in other words). If you take advantage
of this, however, you should be careful to set up initial values for the tag values of all offspring,
otherwise undefined initial values might happen to match the values that you are trying to use to tag
particular individuals. A rule of thumb in programming: undefined values should always be assumed
to take on the most inconvenient value possible.
