This class represents a type of genomic element, with particular mutation types. The genomic
element types currently defined in the simulation are defined as global constants with the same
names used in the SLiM input file â€“ g1, g2, and so forth. Section 1.5.4 presents an overview of the
conceptual role of this class.
