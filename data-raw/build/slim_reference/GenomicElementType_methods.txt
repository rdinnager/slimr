– (+)getValue(string$ key)
Returns the value previously set for the dictionary entry identifier key using setValue(), or NULL if
no value has been set. This dictionary-style functionality is actually provided by the superclass of
GenomicElementType, SLiMEidosDictionary, although that fact is not presently visible in Eidos
since superclasses are not introspectable.
– (void)setMutationFractions(io<MutationType> mutationTypes, numeric proportions)
Set the mutation type fractions contributing to a genomic element type. The mutationTypes vector
should supply the mutation types used by the genomic element (either as MutationType objects or as
integer identifiers), and the proportions vector should be of equal length, specifying the relative
proportion of mutations that will be drawn from each corresponding type (see section 1.5.4). This is
normally a constant in simulations, so be sure you know what you are doing.
– (void)setMutationMatrix(float mutationMatrix)
Sets a new nucleotide mutation matrix for the genomic element type. This replaces the mutation
matrix originally set by initializeGenomicElementType(). This method may only be called in
nucleotide-based models.
– (void)setValue(string$ key, + value)
Sets a value for the dictionary entry identifier key. The value, which may be of any type other than
object, can be fetched later using getValue(). This dictionary-style functionality is actually
provided by the superclass of GenomicElementType, SLiMEidosDictionary, although that fact is
not presently visible in Eidos since superclasses are not introspectable.
