color <–> (string$)
The color used to display genomic elements of this type in SLiMgui. Outside of SLiMgui, this property
still exists, but is not used by SLiM. Colors may be specified by name, or with hexadecimal RGB
values of the form "#RRGGBB" (see the Eidos manual). If color is the empty string, "", SLiMgui’s
default color scheme is used; this is the default for new GenomicElementType objects.
id => (integer$)
The identifier for this genomic element type; for genomic element type g3, for example, this is 3.

mutationFractions => (float)
For each MutationType represented in this genomic element type, this property has the
corresponding fraction of all mutations that will be drawn from that MutationType.
mutationMatrix => (float)
The nucleotide mutation matrix used for this genomic element type, set up by
initializeGenomicElementType() and setMutationMatrix(). This property is only defined in
nucleotide-based models; it is unavailable otherwise.
mutationTypes => (object<MutationType>)
The MutationType instances used by this genomic element type.
tag <–> (integer$)
A user-defined integer value. The value of tag is initially undefined, and it is an error to try to read
it; if you wish it to have a defined value, you must arrange that yourself by explicitly setting its value
prior to using it elsewhere in your code. The value of tag is not used by SLiM; it is free for you to use.
See also the getValue() and setValue() methods, for another way of attaching state to genomic
element types.
