age <–> (integer$)
The age of the individual, measured in generation “ticks”. A newly generated offspring individual will
have an age of 0 in the same generation in which is was created. The age of every individual is
incremented by one at the same point that the generation counter is incremented. The age of
individuals may be changed; usually this only makes sense when setting up the initial state of a model,
however.
color <–> (string$)
The color used to display the individual in SLiMgui. Outside of SLiMgui, this property still exists, but
is not used by SLiM. Colors may be specified by name, or with hexadecimal RGB values of the form
"#RRGGBB" (see the Eidos manual). If color is the empty string, "", SLiMgui’s default (fitness-based)
color scheme is used; this is the default for new Individual objects.
fitnessScaling <–> (float$)
A float scaling factor applied to the individual’s fitness (i.e., the fitness value computed for the
individual will be multiplied by this value). This provides a simple, fast way to modify the fitness of an
individual; conceptually it is similar to returning a fitness effect for the individual from a
fitness(NULL) callback, but without the complexity and performance overhead of implementing
such a callback. To scale the fitness of all individuals in a subpopulation by the same factor, see the
fitnessScaling property of Subpopulation.
The value of fitnessScaling is reset to 1.0 every generation, so that any scaling factor set lasts for
only a single generation. This reset occurs immediately after fitness values are calculated, in both WF
and nonWF models.
genomes => (object<Genome>)
The pair of Genome objects associated with this individual. If only one of the two genomes is desired,
the genome1 or genome2 property may be used.
genome1 => (object<Genome>$)
The first Genome object associated with this individual. This property is particularly useful when you
want the first genome from each of a vector of individuals, as often arises in haploid models.
genome2 => (object<Genome>$)
The second Genome object associated with this individual. This property is particularly useful when
you want the second genome from each of a vector of individuals, as often arises in haploid models.
index => (integer$)
The index of the individual in the individuals vector of its Subpopulation.
migrant => (logical$)
Set to T if the individual migrated during the current generation, F otherwise.
In WF models, this flag is set at the point when a new child is generated if it is a migrant (i.e., if its
source subpopulation is not the same as its subpopulation), and remains valid, with the same value,
for the rest of the individual’s lifetime.
In nonWF models, this flag is F for all new individuals, is set to F in all individuals at the end of the
reproduction generation cycle stage, and is set to T on all individuals moved to a new subpopulation
by takeMigrants(); the T value set by takeMigrants() will remain until it is reset at the end of the
next reproduction generation cycle stage.
pedigreeID => (integer$)
If pedigree tracking is turned on with initializeSLiMOptions(keepPedigrees=T), pedigreeID is
a unique non-negative identifier for each individual in a simulation, never re-used throughout the
TOC I TOC II WF nonWF initialize() Genome Individual Mutation SLiMSim Subpopulation
Eidos events fitness() mateChoice() modifyChild() recombination() interaction() reproduction() 488
duration of the simulation run. This property is also available when tree-sequence recording is
enabled. If neither pedigree tracking nor tree-sequence recording is enabled, this property is
unavailable.
pedigreeParentIDs => (integer)
If pedigree tracking is turned on with initializeSLiMOptions(keepPedigrees=T),
pedigreeParentIDs contains the values of pedigreeID that were possessed by the parents of an
individual; it is thus a vector of two values. If pedigree tracking is not on, this property is unavailable.
Parental values may be -1 if insufficient generations have elapsed for that information to be available
(because the simulation just started, or because a subpopulation is new).
pedigreeGrandparentIDs => (integer)
If pedigree tracking is turned on with initializeSLiMOptions(keepPedigrees=T),
pedigreeGrandparentIDs contains the values of pedigreeID that were possessed by the
grandparents of an individual; it is thus a vector of four values. If pedigree tracking is not on, this
property is unavailable. Grandparental values may be -1 if insufficient generations have elapsed for
that information to be available (because the simulation just started, or because a subpopulation is
new).
sex => (string$)
The sex of the individual. This will be "H" if sex is not enabled in the simulation (i.e., for
hermaphrodites), otherwise "F" or "M" as appropriate.
spatialPosition => (float)
The spatial position of the individual. The length of the spatialPosition property (the number of
coordinates in the spatial position of an individual) depends upon the spatial dimensionality declared
with initializeSLiMOptions(). If the spatial dimensionality is zero (as it is by default), it is an
error to access this property. The elements of this property are identical to the values of the x, y, and z
properties (if those properties are encompassed by the spatial dimensionality of the simulation). In
other words, if the declared dimensionality is "xy", the individual.spatialPosition property is
equivalent to c(individual.x, individual.y); individual.z is not used since it is not
encompassed by the simulation’s dimensionality. This property cannot be set, but the
setSpatialPosition() method may be used to achieve the same thing.
subpopulation => (object<Subpopulation>$)
The Subpopulation object to which the individual belongs.
tag <–> (integer$)
A user-defined integer value (as opposed to tagF, which is of type float). The value of tag is
initially undefined, and it is an error to try to read it; if you wish it to have a defined value, you must
arrange that yourself by explicitly setting its value prior to using it elsewhere in your code. The value
of tag is not used by SLiM; it is free for you to use. See also the getValue() and setValue()
methods, for another way of attaching state to individuals.
Note that the Individual objects used by SLiM are (conceptually) new with every generation, so the
tag value of each new offspring generated in each generation will be initially undefined. If you set a
tag value for an offspring individual inside a modifyChild() callback, that tag value will be
preserved as the offspring individual becomes a parent (across the generation boundary, in other
words). If you take advantage of this, however, you should be careful to set up initial values for the tag
values of all offspring, otherwise undefined initial values might happen to match the values that you
are trying to use to tag particular individuals. A rule of thumb in programming: undefined values
should always be assumed to take on the most inconvenient value possible.

tagF <–> (float$)
A user-defined float value (as opposed to tag, which is of type integer). The value of tagF is
initially undefined, and it is an error to try to read it; if you wish it to have a defined value, you must
arrange that yourself by explicitly setting its value prior to using it elsewhere in your code. The value
of tagF is not used by SLiM; it is free for you to use. See also the getValue() and setValue()
methods, for another way of attaching state to individuals.
Note that at present, although many classes in SLiM have an integer-type tag property, only
Individual has a float-type tagF property, because attaching model state to individuals seems to
be particularly common and useful. If a tagF property would be helpful on another class, it would be
easy to add.
See the description of the tag property above for additional comments.
uniqueMutations => (object<Mutation>)
All of the Mutation objects present in this individual. Mutations present in both genomes will occur
only once in this property, and the mutations will be given in sorted order by position, so this
property is similar to sortBy(unique(individual.genomes.mutations), "position"). It is not
identical to that call, only because if multiple mutations exist at the exact same position, they may be
sorted differently by this method than they would be by sortBy(). This method is provided primarily
for speed; it executes much faster than the Eidos equivalent above. Indeed, it is faster than just
individual.genomes.mutations, and gives uniquing and sorting on top of that, so it is
advantageous unless duplicate entries for homozygous mutations are actually needed.
x <–> (float$)
A user-defined float value. The value of x is initially undefined (i.e., has an effectively random value
that could be different every time you run your model); if you wish it to have a defined value, you
must arrange that yourself by explicitly setting its value prior to using it elsewhere in your code,
typically in a modifyChild() callback. The value of x is not used by SLiM unless the optional
“continuous space” facility is enabled with the dimensionality parameter to
initializeSLiMOptions(), in which case x will be understood to represent the x coordinate of the
individual in space. If continuous space is not enabled, you may use x as an additional tag value of
type float.
y <–> (float$)
A user-defined float value. The value of y is initially undefined (i.e., has an effectively random value
that could be different every time you run your model); if you wish it to have a defined value, you
must arrange that yourself by explicitly setting its value prior to using it elsewhere in your code,
typically in a modifyChild() callback. The value of y is not used by SLiM unless the optional
“continuous space” facility is enabled with the dimensionality parameter to
initializeSLiMOptions(), in which case y will be understood to represent the y coordinate of the
individual in space (if the dimensionality is "xy" or "xyz"). If continuous space is not enabled, or the
dimensionality is not "xy" or "xyz", you may use y as an additional tag value of type float.
z <–> (float$)
A user-defined float value. The value of z is initially undefined (i.e., has an effectively random value
that could be different every time you run your model); if you wish it to have a defined value, you
must arrange that yourself by explicitly setting its value prior to using it elsewhere in your code,
typically in a modifyChild() callback. The value of z is not used by SLiM unless the optional
“continuous space” facility is enabled with the dimensionality parameter to
initializeSLiMOptions(), in which case z will be understood to represent the z coordinate of the
individual in space (if the dimensionality is "xyz"). If continuous space is not enabled, or the
dimensionality is not "xyz", you may use z as an additional tag value of type float.
