– (float)drawSelectionCoefficient([integer$ n = 1])
Draws and returns a vector of n selection coefficients using the currently defined distribution of fitness
effects (DFE) for the target mutation type. See section 23.9 above for discussion of the supported
distributions and their uses. If the DFE is type "s", this method will result in synchronous execution
of the DFE’s script.
– (+)getValue(string$ key)
Returns the value previously set for the dictionary entry identifier key using setValue(), or NULL if
no value has been set. This dictionary-style functionality is actually provided by the superclass of
MutationType, SLiMEidosDictionary, although that fact is not presently visible in Eidos since
superclasses are not introspectable.
– (void)setDistribution(string$ distributionType, ...)
Set the distribution of fitness effects for a mutation type. The distributionType may be "f", in
which case the ellipsis ... should supply a numeric$ fixed selection coefficient; "e", in which case
the ellipsis should supply a numeric$ mean selection coefficient for the exponential distribution; "g",
in which case the ellipsis should supply a numeric$ mean selection coefficient and a numeric$ alpha
shape parameter for a gamma distribution; "n", in which case the ellipsis should supply a numeric$
mean selection coefficient and a numeric$ sigma (standard deviation) parameter for a normal
distribution; "w", in which case the ellipsis should supply a numeric$ λ scale parameter and a
numeric$ k shape parameter for a Weibull distribution; or "s", in which case the ellipsis should
supply a string$ Eidos script parameter. See section 23.9 above for discussions of these distributions
and their uses. The DFE for a mutation type is normally a constant in simulations, so be sure you
know what you are doing.
– (void)setValue(string$ key, + value)
Sets a value for the dictionary entry identifier key. The value, which may be of any type other than
object, can be fetched later using getValue(). This dictionary-style functionality is actually
provided by the superclass of MutationType, SLiMEidosDictionary, although that fact is not
presently visible in Eidos since superclasses are not introspectable.
