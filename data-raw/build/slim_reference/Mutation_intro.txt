This class represents a single point mutation. Mutations can be shared by the genomes of many
individuals; if they reach fixation, they are converted to Substitution objects.
Although Mutation has a tag property, like most SLiM classes, the subpopID can also store
custom values if you donâ€™t need to track the origin subpopulation of mutations (see below).
Section 1.5.2 presents an overview of the conceptual role of this class.
