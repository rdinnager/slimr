id => (integer$)
The identifier for this mutation. Each mutation created during a run receives an immutable identifier
that will be unique across the duration of the run. These identifiers are not re-used during a run,
except that if a population file is loaded from disk, the loaded mutations will receive their original
identifier values as saved in the population file.
mutationType => (object<MutationType>$)
The MutationType from which this mutation was drawn.
nucleotide <–> (string$)
A string representing the nucleotide associated with this mutation; this will be "A", "C", "G", or
"T". If the mutation is not nucleotide-based, this property is unavailable.
nucleotideValue <–> (integer$)
An integer representing the nucleotide associated with this mutation; this will be 0 (A), 1 (C), 2 (G),
or 3 (T). If the mutation is not nucleotide-based, this property is unavailable.
originGeneration => (integer$)
The generation in which this mutation arose.
position => (integer$)
The position in the chromosome of this mutation.
selectionCoeff => (float$)
The selection coefficient of the mutation, drawn from the distribution of fitness effects of its
MutationType. If a mutation has a selectionCoeff of s, the multiplicative fitness effect of the
mutation in a homozygote is 1+s; in a heterozygote it is 1+hs, where h is the dominance coefficient
kept by the mutation type (see section 23.9.1).
Note that this property has a quirk: it is stored internally in SLiM using a single-precision float, not the
double-precision float type normally used by Eidos. This means that if you set a mutation mut’s
selection coefficient to some number x, mut.selectionCoeff==x may be F due to floating-point
rounding error. Comparisons of floating-point numbers for exact equality is often a bad idea, but this
is one case where it may fail unexpectedly. Instead, it is recommended to use the id or tag properties
to identify particular mutations.
subpopID <–> (integer$)
The identifier of the subpopulation in which this mutation arose. This property can be used to track
the ancestry of mutations through their subpopulation of origin. For an overview of other ways of
tracking genetic ancestry, including true local ancestry at each position on the chromosome, see
sections 1.7 and 14.7.
If you don’t care which subpopulation a mutation originated in, the subpopID may be used as an
arbitrary integer “tag” value for any purpose you wish; SLiM does not do anything with the value of
subpopID except propagate it to Substitution objects and report it in output. (It must still be >= 0,
however, since SLiM object identifiers are limited to nonnegative integers).

tag <–> (integer$)
A user-defined integer value. The value of tag is initially undefined, and it is an error to try to read
it; if you wish it to have a defined value, you must arrange that yourself by explicitly setting its value
prior to using it elsewhere in your code. The value of tag is not used by SLiM; it is free for you to use.
