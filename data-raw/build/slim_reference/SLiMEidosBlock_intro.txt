This class represents a block of Eidos code registered in a SLiM simulation. All Eidos events and
Eidos callbacks defined in the SLiM input file of the current simulation are instantiated as
SLiMEidosBlock objects and are available through the scriptBlocks property of SLiMSim; see
section 24.13.1. In addition, new script blocks can be created programmatically and registered
with the simulation, and registered script blocks can be deregistered; see the ‑register...() and
‑deregisterScriptBlock() methods of SLiMSim in section 24.13.2. The currently executing script
block is available through the self global; see section 25.9.
