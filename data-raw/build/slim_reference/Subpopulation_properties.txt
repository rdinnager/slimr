cloningRate => (float)
The fraction of children in the next generation that will be produced by cloning (as opposed to
biparental mating). In non-sexual (i.e. hermaphroditic) simulations, this property is a singleton float
representing the overall subpopulation cloning rate. In sexual simulations, this property is a float
vector with two values: the cloning rate for females (at index 0) and for males (at index 1).
firstMaleIndex => (integer$)
The index of the first male individual in the subpopulation. The genomes vector is sorted into females
first and males second; firstMaleIndex gives the position of the boundary between those sections.
Note, however, that there are two genomes per diploid individual, and the firstMaleIndex is not
premultiplied by 2; you must multiply it by 2 before using it to decide whether a given index into
genomes is a genome for a male or a female. The firstMaleIndex property is also the number of
females in the subpopulation, given this design. For non-sexual (i.e. hermaphroditic) simulations, this
property has an undefined value and should not be used.
fitnessScaling <–> (float$)
A float scaling factor applied to the fitness of all individuals in this subpopulation (i.e., the fitness
value computed for each individual will be multiplied by this value). This is primarily of use in
nonWF models, where fitness is absolute, rather than in WF models, where fitness is relative (and thus
a constant factor multiplied into the fitness of every individual will make no difference); however, it
may be used in either type of model. This provides a simple, fast way to modify the fitness of all
individuals in a subpopulation; conceptually it is similar to returning the same fitness effect for all
individuals in the subpopulation from a fitness(NULL) callback, but without the complexity and
performance overhead of implementing such a callback. To scale the fitness of individuals by different
(individual-specific) factors, see the fitnessScaling property of Individual.
The value of fitnessScaling is reset to 1.0 every generation, so that any scaling factor set lasts for
only a single generation. This reset occurs immediately after fitness values are calculated, in both WF
and nonWF models.
genomes => (object<Genome>)
All of the genomes contained by the subpopulation; there are two genomes per diploid individual.
id => (integer$)
The identifier for this subpopulation; for subpopulation p3, for example, this is 3.
immigrantSubpopFractions => (float)
The expected value of the fraction of children in the next generation that are immigrants arriving from
particular subpopulations.
immigrantSubpopIDs => (integer)
The identifiers of the particular subpopulations from which immigrants will arrive in the next
generation.
individualCount => (integer$)
The number of individuals in the subpopulation; one-half of the number of genomes.
individuals => (object<Individual>)
All of the individuals contained by the subpopulation. Each individual is diploid and thus contains
two Genome objects. See the sampleIndividuals() and subsetIndividuals() for fast ways to get
a subset of the individuals in a subpopulation.

selfingRate => (float$)
The expected value of the fraction of children in the next generation that will be produced by selfing
(as opposed to biparental mating). Selfing is only possible in non-sexual (i.e. hermaphroditic)
simulations; for sexual simulations this property always has a value of 0.0.
sexRatio => (float$)
For sexual simulations, the sex ratio for the subpopulation. This is defined, in SLiM, as the fraction of
the subpopulation that is male; in other words, it is actually the M:(M+F) ratio. For non-sexual (i.e.
hermaphroditic) simulations, this property has an undefined value and should not be used.
spatialBounds => (float)
The spatial boundaries of the subpopulation. The length of the spatialBounds property depends
upon the spatial dimensionality declared with initializeSLiMOptions(). If the spatial
dimensionality is zero (as it is by default), the value of this property is float(0) (a zero-length float
vector). Otherwise, minimums are supplied for each coordinate used by the dimensionality of the
simulation, followed by maximums for each. In other words, if the declared dimensionality is "xy",
the spatialBounds property will contain values (x0, y0, x1, y1); bounds for the z coordinate
will not be included in that case, since that coordinate is not used in the simulation’s dimensionality.
This property cannot be set, but the setSpatialBounds() method may be used to achieve the same
thing.
tag <–> (integer$)
A user-defined integer value. The value of tag is initially undefined, and it is an error to try to read
it; if you wish it to have a defined value, you must arrange that yourself by explicitly setting its value
prior to using it elsewhere in your code. The value of tag is not used by SLiM; it is free for you to use.
See also the getValue() and setValue() methods, for another way of attaching state to
subpopulations.
