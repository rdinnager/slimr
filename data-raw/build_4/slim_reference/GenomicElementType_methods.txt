– (void)setMutationFractions(io<MutationType> mutationTypes, numeric proportions)
Set the mutation type fractions contributing to a genomic element type. The mutationTypes vector
should supply the mutation types used by the genomic element (either as MutationType objects or as
integer identifiers), and the proportions vector should be of equal length, specifying the relative
proportion of mutations that will be drawn from each corresponding type (see section 1.5.4). This is
normally a constant in simulations, so be sure you know what you are doing.
– (void)setMutationMatrix(float mutationMatrix)
Sets a new nucleotide mutation matrix for the genomic element type. This replaces the mutation
matrix originally set by initializeGenomicElementType(). This method may only be called in
nucleotide-based models.
