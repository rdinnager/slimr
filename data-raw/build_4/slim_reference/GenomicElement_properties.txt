endPosition => (integer$)
The last position in the chromosome contained by this genomic element.
genomicElementType => (object<GenomicElementType>$)
The GenomicElementType object that defines the behavior of this genomic element.
startPosition => (integer$)
The first position in the chromosome contained by this genomic element.
tag <â€“> (integer$)
A user-defined integer value. The value of tag is initially undefined, and it is an error to try to read
it; if you wish it to have a defined value, you must arrange that yourself by explicitly setting its value
prior to using it elsewhere in your code. The value of tag is not used by SLiM; it is free for you to use.
