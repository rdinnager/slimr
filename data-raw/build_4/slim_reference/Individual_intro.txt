This class represents a single simulated individual. Individuals in SLiM are diploid, and thus
contain two Genome objects. Most functionality in SLiM is contained in the Genome class; the
Individual class is mostly a convenient way to treat the pairs of genomes associated with an
individual as a single object, and to associate a tag value with individuals. Section 1.5.1 presents
an overview of the conceptual role of this class.
