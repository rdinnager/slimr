allKeys => (string)
This Dictionary property has an override in LogFile to return, in order, the names of the log file
columns, which are the keys for LogFile’s dictionary.
filePath => (string$)
The path of the log file being written to. This may be changed with setFilePath().
logInterval => (integer$)
The interval for automatic logging; a new row of data will be logged every logInterval ticks. This
may be changed with setLogInterval(). If automatic logging has been disabled, this property will
be 0.
precision <–> (integer$)
The precision of float output. To be exact, precision specifies the preferred number of significant
digits that will be output for float values. The default is 6; values in [1,22] are legal, but 17 is
probably the largest value that makes sense given the limits of double-precision floating point.
tag <–> (integer$)
A user-defined integer value. The value of tag is initially undefined, and it is an error to try to read
it; if you wish it to have a defined value, you must arrange that yourself by explicitly setting its value
prior to using it elsewhere in your code. The value of tag is not used by SLiM; it is free for you to use.
