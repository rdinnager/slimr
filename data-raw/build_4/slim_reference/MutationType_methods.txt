– (float)drawSelectionCoefficient([integer$ n = 1])
Draws and returns a vector of n selection coefficients using the currently defined distribution of fitness
effects (DFE) for the target mutation type. See section 24.11 above for discussion of the supported
distributions and their uses. If the DFE is type "s", this method will result in synchronous execution
of the DFE’s script.
– (void)setDistribution(string$ distributionType, ...)
Set the distribution of fitness effects for a mutation type. The distributionType may be "f", in
which case the ellipsis ... should supply a numeric$ fixed selection coefficient; "e", in which case
the ellipsis should supply a numeric$ mean selection coefficient for the exponential distribution; "g",
in which case the ellipsis should supply a numeric$ mean selection coefficient and a numeric$ alpha
shape parameter for a gamma distribution; "n", in which case the ellipsis should supply a numeric$
mean selection coefficient and a numeric$ sigma (standard deviation) parameter for a normal
distribution; "w", in which case the ellipsis should supply a numeric$ λ scale parameter and a
numeric$ k shape parameter for a Weibull distribution; or "s", in which case the ellipsis should
supply a string$ Eidos script parameter. See section 24.11 above for discussions of these
distributions and their uses. The DFE for a mutation type is normally a constant in simulations, so be
sure you know what you are doing.
