This class represents a block of Eidos code registered in a SLiM simulation. All Eidos events and
Eidos callbacks defined in the SLiM input file of the current simulation are instantiated as
SLiMEidosBlock objects and are available through the allScriptBlocks property of Community and
the scriptBlocks property of Species; see sections 24.3.1 and 24.14.1. In addition, new script
blocks can be created programmatically and registered with the simulation, and registered script
blocks can be deregistered; see the ‑register...() and ‑deregisterScriptBlock() methods of
