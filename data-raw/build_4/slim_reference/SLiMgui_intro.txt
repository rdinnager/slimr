This class represents the SLiMgui application. When running under SLiMgui, a global object
singleton constant of class SLiMgui will be defined, named slimgui. This object can be used to
query and control the SLiMgui application. When running at the command line, the slimgui
object will not exist; to determine whether the simulation is running under SLiMgui, one may
therefore test exists("slimgui"). If a model needs to run both at the command line and under
SLiMgui, all uses of the slimgui object should be protected by if (exists("slimgui")) to avoid
errors.
