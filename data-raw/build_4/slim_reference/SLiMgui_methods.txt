– (void)openDocument(string$ filePath)
Open the document at filePath in SLiMgui, if possible. Supported document types include SLiM
model files (typically with a .slim path extension), text files (typically with a .txt path extension,
and opened as untitled model files), and PNG, JPG/JPEG, BMP, and GIF image file formats
(typically .png / .jpg / .jpeg / .bmp / .gif, respectively). (Note that in SLiMguiLegacy, PDF files
(.pdf) are supported but these other image file formats are not.) This method can be particularly
useful for opening images created by the simulation itself, often by sublaunching a plotting process in
R or another environment; see section 14.8 for an example.
– (void)pauseExecution(string$ filePath)
Pauses a model that is playing in SLiMgui. This is essentially equivalent to clicking the “Play” button
to stop the execution of the model. Execution can be resumed by the user, by clicking the “Play”
button again; unlike calling stop() or simulationFinished(), the simulation is not terminated.
This method can be useful for debugging or exploratory purposes, to pause the model at a point of
interest. Execution is paused at the end of the currently executing tick, not mid-tick.
If the model is being profiled, or is executing forward to a tick number entered in the tick field,
pauseExecution() will do nothing; by design, pauseExecution() only pauses execution when
SLiMgui is doing a simple “Play” of the model.
