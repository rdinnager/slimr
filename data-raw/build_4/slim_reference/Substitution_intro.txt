This class represents a mutation that has been fixed; Mutation objects are converted to
Substitution objects upon fixation. Its properties are thus very similar to those of Mutation.
Section 1.5.2 presents an overview of the conceptual role of this class.

Since Substitution objects represent fixation events that occurred in the past, they are
relatively immutable. However, since it may be useful to attach (possibly dynamic) state to
substitutions, their tag and subpopID properties are mutable, and they also provide the same
getValue() / setValue() functionality as Mutation (inherited from the Eidos class Dictionary).
Values set on a Mutation object will carry over to the corresponding Substitution object
automatically upon fixation.
