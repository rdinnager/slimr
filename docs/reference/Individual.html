    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="format"><a class="anchor" href="#format"></a>Format</h2>

    <p>An object of class <code>list</code> of length 27.</p>
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="details"><a class="anchor" href="#details"></a>Details</h2>

    <p>This class represents a single simulated individual. Individuals in
SLiM are diploid, and thus
contain two Genome objects. Most functionality in SLiM is contained in the
Genome class; the
Individual class is mostly a convenient way to treat the pairs of genomes
associated with an
individual as a single object, and to associate a tag value with individuals.
Section 1.5.1 presents
an overview of the conceptual role of this class.
This class has the following methods (functions):</p><ul>
<li><p><code><a href='containsMutations.html'>containsMutations</a></code></p></li>
<li><p><code><a href='countOfMutationsOfType.html'>countOfMutationsOfType</a></code></p></li>
<li><p><code><a href='relatedness.html'>relatedness</a></code></p></li>
<li><p><code><a href='setSpatialPosition.html'>setSpatialPosition</a></code></p></li>
<li><p><code><a href='sumOfMutationsOfType.html'>sumOfMutationsOfType</a></code></p></li>
<li><p><code><a href='uniqueMutationsOfType.html'>uniqueMutationsOfType</a></code></p></li>
</ul><p>This class has the following properties:</p><dl>
<dt>age</dt><dd><p>A property of type integer. It is of length one (a singleton). This
property is a variable, so it is modifiable. <strong>Property Description:</strong>
The age of the individual, measured in generation "ticks". A newly generated
offspring individual will have an age of 0 in the same generation in which
is was created. The age of every individual is incremented by one at the same
point that the generation counter is incremented. The age of individuals may be
changed; usually this only makes sense when setting up the initial state of a
model, however.</p></dd>
<dt>color</dt><dd><p>A property of type string. It is of length one (a singleton). This
property is a variable, so it is modifiable. <strong>Property Description:</strong>
The color used to display the individual in SLiMgui. Outside of SLiMgui, this
property still exists, but is not used by SLiM. Colors may be specified by name,
or with hexadecimal RGB values of the form "#RRGGBB" (see the Eidos manual). If
color is the empty string, "", SLiMgui's default (fitness-based) color scheme is
used; this is the default for new Individual objects.</p></dd>
<dt>fitnessScaling</dt><dd><p>A property of type float. It is of length one (a
singleton). This property is a variable, so it is modifiable. <strong>Property
Description:</strong> A float scaling factor applied to the individual's fitness
(i.e., the fitness value computed for the individual will be multiplied by this
value). This provides a simple, fast way to modify the fitness of an individual;
conceptually it is similar to returning a fitness effect for the individual from
a fitness(NULL) callback, but without the complexity and performance overhead
of implementing such a callback. To scale the fitness of all individuals
in a subpopulation by the same factor, see the fitnessScaling property of
Subpopulation. The value of fitnessScaling is reset to 1.0 every generation,
so that any scaling factor set lasts for only a single generation. This reset
occurs immediately after fitness values are calculated, in both WF and nonWF
models.</p></dd>
<dt>genomes</dt><dd><p>A property of type Genome object. This property is a constant, so
it is not modifiable. <strong>Property Description:</strong> The pair of Genome objects
associated with this individual. If only one of the two genomes is desired, the
genome1 or genome2 property may be used.</p></dd>
<dt>genome1</dt><dd><p>A property of type Genome object. It is of length one
(a singleton). This property is a constant, so it is not modifiable.
<strong>Property Description:</strong> The first Genome object associated with this
individual. This property is particularly useful when you want the first genome
from each of a vector of individuals, as often arises in haploid models.</p></dd>
<dt>genome2</dt><dd><p>A property of type Genome object. It is of length one
(a singleton). This property is a constant, so it is not modifiable.
<strong>Property Description:</strong> The second Genome object associated with this
individual. This property is particularly useful when you want the second genome
from each of a vector of individuals, as often arises in haploid models.</p></dd>
<dt>index</dt><dd><p>A property of type integer. It is of length one (a singleton). This
property is a constant, so it is not modifiable. <strong>Property Description:</strong>
The index of the individual in the individuals vector of its Subpopulation.</p></dd>
<dt>migrant</dt><dd><p>A property of type logical. It is of length one (a singleton).
This property is a constant, so it is not modifiable. <strong>Property
Description:</strong> Set to T if the individual migrated during the current generation,
F otherwise. In WF models, this flag is set at the point when a new child is
generated if it is a migrant (i.e., if its source subpopulation is not the
same as its subpopulation), and remains valid, with the same value, for the
rest of the individual's lifetime. In nonWF models, this flag is F for all
new individuals, is set to F in all individuals at the end of the reproduction
generation cycle stage, and is set to T on all individuals moved to a new
subpopulation by takeMigrants(); the T value set by takeMigrants() will remain
until it is reset at the end of the next reproduction generation cycle stage.</p></dd>
<dt>pedigreeID</dt><dd><p>A property of type integer. It is of length one
(a singleton). This property is a constant, so it is not modifiable.
<strong>Property Description:</strong> If pedigree tracking is turned on with
initializeSLiMOptions(keepPedigrees=T), pedigreeID is a unique non-negative
identifier for each individual in a simulation, never re-used throughout the
duration of the simulation run. This property is also available when tree-
sequence recording is enabled. If neither pedigree tracking nor tree-sequence
recording is enabled, this property is unavailable.</p></dd>
<dt>pedigreeParentIDs</dt><dd><p>A property of type integer. This property is
a constant, so it is not modifiable. <strong>Property Description:</strong> If
pedigree tracking is turned on with initializeSLiMOptions(keepPedigrees=T),
pedigreeParentIDs contains the values of pedigreeID that were possessed by
the parents of an individual; it is thus a vector of two values. If pedigree
tracking is not on, this property is unavailable. Parental values may be -1
if insufficient generations have elapsed for that information to be available
(because the simulation just started, or because a subpopulation is new).</p></dd>
<dt>pedigreeGrandparentIDs</dt><dd><p>A property of type integer. This property
is a constant, so it is not modifiable. <strong>Property Description:</strong> If
pedigree tracking is turned on with initializeSLiMOptions(keepPedigrees=T),
pedigreeGrandparentIDs contains the values of pedigreeID that were possessed
by the grandparents of an individual; it is thus a vector of four values. If
pedigree tracking is not on, this property is unavailable. Grandparental values
may be -1 if insufficient generations have elapsed for that information to be
available (because the simulation just started, or because a subpopulation is
new).</p></dd>
<dt>reproductiveOutput</dt><dd><p>A property of type integer. It is of length
one (a singleton). This property is a constant, so it is not modifiable.
<strong>Property Description:</strong> If pedigree tracking is turned on with
initializeSLiMOptions(keepPedigrees=T), reproductiveOutput contains the
number of offspring for which this individual has been a parent. If pedigree
tracking is not on, this property is unavailable. If an individual is a
parent by cloning or selfing, or as both parents for a biparental mating,
this value is incremented by two. Involvement of an individual as a parent
for an addRecombinant() call does not change this property's value, since the
reproductive contribution in that case is unclear; one must conduct separate
bookkeeping for that case if necessary. This property is only useful in nonWF
models, since in WF models the parental generation dies immediately after
reproduction, giving no opportunity to query this property. For WF models (and
nonWF models, too), see the Subpopulation property lifetimeReproductiveOutput.</p></dd>
<dt>sex</dt><dd><p>A property of type string. It is of length one (a singleton). This
property is a constant, so it is not modifiable. <strong>Property Description:</strong>
The sex of the individual. This will be "H" if sex is not enabled in the
simulation (i.e., for hermaphrodites), otherwise "F" or "M" as appropriate.</p></dd>
<dt>spatialPosition</dt><dd><p>A property of type float. This property is a constant,
so it is not modifiable. <strong>Property Description:</strong> The spatial position
of the individual. The length of the spatialPosition property (the number
of coordinates in the spatial position of an individual) depends upon the
spatial dimensionality declared with initializeSLiMOptions(). If the spatial
dimensionality is zero (as it is by default), it is an error to access
this property. The elements of this property are identical to the values
of the x, y, and z properties (if those properties are encompassed by the
spatial dimensionality of the simulation). In other words, if the declared
dimensionality is "xy", the individual.spatialPosition property is equivalent
to c(individual.x, individual.y); individual.z is not used since it is not
encompassed by the simulation's dimensionality. This property cannot be set, but
the setSpatialPosition() method may be used to achieve the same thing.</p></dd>
<dt>subpopulation</dt><dd><p>A property of type Subpopulation object. It is of length
one (a singleton). This property is a constant, so it is not modifiable.
<strong>Property Description:</strong> The Subpopulation object to which the individual
belongs.</p></dd>
<dt>tag</dt><dd><p>A property of type integer. It is of length one (a singleton). This
property is a variable, so it is modifiable. <strong>Property Description:</strong>
A user-defined integer value (as opposed to tagF, which is of type float).
The value of tag is initially undefined, and it is an error to try to read
it; if you wish it to have a defined value, you must arrange that yourself
by explicitly setting its value prior to using it elsewhere in your code.
The value of tag is not used by SLiM; it is free for you to use. See also the
getValue() and setValue() methods (provided by the Dictionary class; see the
Eidos manual), for another way of attaching state to individuals. Note that the
Individual objects used by SLiM are (conceptually) new with every generation,
so the tag value of each new offspring generated in each generation will be
initially undefined. If you set a tag value for an offspring individual inside
a modifyChild() callback, that tag value will be preserved as the offspring
individual becomes a parent (across the generation boundary, in other words).
If you take advantage of this, however, you should be careful to set up initial
values for the tag values of all offspring, otherwise undefined initial values
might happen to match the values that you are trying to use to tag particular
individuals. A rule of thumb in programming: undefined values should always be
assumed to take on the most inconvenient value possible.</p></dd>
<dt>tagF</dt><dd><p>A property of type float. It is of length one (a singleton). This
property is a variable, so it is modifiable. <strong>Property Description:</strong>
A user-defined float value (as opposed to tag, which is of type integer).
The value of tagF is initially undefined, and it is an error to try to read
it; if you wish it to have a defined value, you must arrange that yourself
by explicitly setting its value prior to using it elsewhere in your code. The
value of tagF is not used by SLiM; it is free for you to use. See also the
getValue() and setValue() methods (provided by the Dictionary class; see the
Eidos manual), for another way of attaching state to individuals. Note that at
present, although many classes in SLiM have an integer-type tag property, only
Individual has a float-type tagF property, because attaching model state to
individuals seems to be particularly common and useful. If a tagF property would
be helpful on another class, it would be easy to add. See the description of the
tag property above for additional comments.</p></dd>
<dt>uniqueMutations</dt><dd><p>A property of type Mutation object. This property
is a constant, so it is not modifiable. <strong>Property Description:</strong>
All of the Mutation objects present in this individual. Mutations present
in both genomes will occur only once in this property, and the mutations
will be given in sorted order by position, so this property is similar to
sortBy(unique(individual.genomes.mutations), "position"). It is not identical
to that call, only because if multiple mutations exist at the exact same
position, they may be sorted differently by this method than they would
be by sortBy(). This method is provided primarily for speed; it executes
much faster than the Eidos equivalent above. Indeed, it is faster than just
individual.genomes.mutations, and gives uniquing and sorting on top of that,
so it is advantageous unless duplicate entries for homozygous mutations are
actually needed.</p></dd>
<dt>x</dt><dd><p>A property of type float. It is of length one (a singleton). This
property is a variable, so it is modifiable. <strong>Property Description:</strong>
A user-defined float value. The value of x is initially undefined (i.e., has
an effectively random value that could be different every time you run your
model); if you wish it to have a defined value, you must arrange that yourself
by explicitly setting its value prior to using it elsewhere in your code,
typically in a modifyChild() callback. The value of x is not used by SLiM unless
the optional "continuous space" facility is enabled with the dimensionality
parameter to initializeSLiMOptions(), in which case x will be understood to
represent the x coordinate of the individual in space. If continuous space is
not enabled, you may use x as an additional tag value of type float.</p></dd>
<dt>y</dt><dd><p>A property of type float. It is of length one (a singleton). This
property is a variable, so it is modifiable. <strong>Property Description:</strong>
A user-defined float value. The value of y is initially undefined (i.e., has
an effectively random value that could be different every time you run your
model); if you wish it to have a defined value, you must arrange that yourself
by explicitly setting its value prior to using it elsewhere in your code,
typically in a modifyChild() callback. The value of y is not used by SLiM unless
the optional "continuous space" facility is enabled with the dimensionality
parameter to initializeSLiMOptions(), in which case y will be understood to
represent the y coordinate of the individual in space (if the dimensionality is
"xy" or "xyz"). If continuous space is not enabled, or the dimensionality is not
"xy" or "xyz", you may use y as an additional tag value of type float.</p></dd>
<dt>z</dt><dd><p>A property of type float. It is of length one (a singleton). This
property is a variable, so it is modifiable. <strong>Property Description:</strong>
A user-defined float value. The value of z is initially undefined (i.e., has
an effectively random value that could be different every time you run your
model); if you wish it to have a defined value, you must arrange that yourself
by explicitly setting its value prior to using it elsewhere in your code,
typically in a modifyChild() callback. The value of z is not used by SLiM unless
the optional "continuous space" facility is enabled with the dimensionality
parameter to initializeSLiMOptions(), in which case z will be understood to
represent the z coordinate of the individual in space (if the dimensionality
is "xyz"). If continuous space is not enabled, or the dimensionality is not
"xyz", you may use z as an additional tag value of type float. 24.6.2 Individual
methods - (logical)containsMutations(object&lt;Mutation&gt; mutations) Returns a
logical vector indicating whether each of the mutations in mutations is present
in the individual (in either of its genomes); each element in the returned
vector indicates whether the corresponding mutation is present (T) or absent
(F). This method is provided for speed; it is much faster than the corresponding
Eidos code. - (integer$)countOfMutationsOfType(io&lt;MutationType&gt;$ mutType)
Returns the number of mutations that are of the type specified by mutType, out
of all of the mutations in the individual (in both of its genomes; a mutation
that is present in both genomes counts twice). If you need a vector of the
matching Mutation objects, rather than just a count, you should probably use
uniqueMutationsOfType(). This method is provided for speed; it is much faster
than the corresponding Eidos code. - (float)relatedness(object&lt;Individual&gt;
individuals) Returns a vector containing the degrees of relatedness between
the receiver and each of the individuals in individuals. The relatedness
between A and B is always 1.0 if A and B are actually the same individual;
this facility works even if SLiM's optional pedigree tracking is turned
off (in which case all other relatedness values will be 0.0. Otherwise, if
pedigree tracking is turned on with initializeSLiMOptions(keepPedigrees=T),
this method will use the pedigree information described in section 24.6.1 to
construct a relatedness estimate. More specifically, if information about the
grandparental generation is available, then each grandparent shared by A and
B contributes 0.125 towards the total relatedness, for a maximum value of 0.5
with four shared grandparents. If grandparental information is unavailable,
then if parental information is available it is used, with each parent shared
by A and B contributing 0.25, again for a maximum of 0.5. If even parental
information is unavailable, then the relatedness is assumed to be 0.0. Again,
however, if A and B are the same individual, the relatedness will be 1.0 in all
cases. Note that this relatedness is simply pedigree-based relatedness. This
does not necessarily correspond to genetic relatedness, because of the effects
of factors like assortment and recombination. + (void)setSpatialPosition(float
position) Sets the spatial position of the individual (as accessed through
the spatialPosition property). The length of position (the number of
coordinates in the spatial position of an individual) depends upon the
spatial dimensionality declared with initializeSLiMOptions(). If the spatial
dimensionality is zero (as it is by default), it is an error to call this
method. The elements of position are set into the values of the x, y, and z
properties (if those properties are encompassed by the spatial dimensionality
of the simulation). In other words, if the declared dimensionality is "xy",
calling individual.setSpatialPosition(c(1.0, 0.5)) property is equivalent
to individual.x = 1.0; individual.y = 0.5; individual.z is not set (even if
a third value is supplied in position) since it is not encompassed by the
simulation's dimensionality in this example. Note that this is an Eidos class
method, somewhat unusually, which allows it to work in a special way when
called on a vector of individuals. When the target vector of individuals is
non-singleton, this method can do one of two things. If position contains
just a single point (i.e., is equal in length to the spatial dimensionality of
the model), the spatial position of all of the target individuals will be set
to the given point. Alternatively, if position contains one point per target
individual (i.e., is equal in length to the number of individuals multiplied by
the spatial dimensionality of the model), the spatial position of each target
individual will be set to the corresponding point from position (where the
point data is concatenated, not interleaved, just as it would be returned by
accessing the spatialPosition property on the vector of target individuals).
Calling this method with a position vector of any other length is an error.
- (float$)sumOfMutationsOfType(io&lt;MutationType&gt;$ mutType) Returns the sum of
the selection coefficients of all mutations that are of the type specified by
mutType, out of all of the mutations in the genomes of the individual. This is
often useful in models that use a particular mutation type to represent QTLs
with additive effects; in that context, sumOfMutationsOfType() will provide the
sum of the additive effects of the QTLs for the given mutation type. This method
is provided for speed; it is much faster than the corresponding Eidos code. Note
that this method also exists on Genome, for cases in which the sum for just one
genome is desired. - (object&lt;Mutation&gt;)uniqueMutationsOfType(io&lt;MutationType&gt;$
mutType) Returns an object vector of all the mutations that are of the type
specified by mutType, out of all of the mutations in the individual. Mutations
present in both genomes will occur only once in the result of this method,
and the mutations will be given in sorted order by position, so this method
is similar to sortBy(unique(individual.genomes.mutationsOfType(mutType)),
"position"). It is not identical to that call, only because if multiple
mutations exist at the exact same position, they may be sorted differently
by this method than they would be by sortBy(). If you just need a count of
the matching Mutation objects, rather than a vector of the matches, use -
countOfMutationsOfType(). This method is provided for speed; it is much
faster than the corresponding Eidos code. Indeed, it is faster than just
individual.genomes.mutationsOfType(mutType), and gives uniquing and sorting
on top of that, so it is advantageous unless duplicate entries for homozygous
mutations are actually needed.</p></dd>
