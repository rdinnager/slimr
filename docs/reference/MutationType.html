<dt>color</dt><dd><p>A property of type string or string or logical or float or string
or float or integer or integer or string or logical or integer. It is of
length one (a singleton). This property is a variable, so it is modifiable.
<strong>Property Description:</strong> The color used to display mutations of this type
in SLiMgui. Outside of SLiMgui, this property still exists, but is not used
by SLiM. Colors may be specified by name, or with hexadecimal RGB values of
the form "#RRGGBB" (see the Eidos manual). If color is the empty string, "",
SLiMgui’s default (selection-coefficient–based) color scheme is used; this is
the default for new MutationType objects.</p></dd>
<dt>colorSubstitution</dt><dd><p>A property of type string or string or logical or float
or string or float or integer or integer or string or logical or integer. It is
of length one (a singleton). This property is a variable, so it is modifiable.
<strong>Property Description:</strong> The color used to display substitutions of this
type in SLiMgui (see the discussion for the colorSubstitution property of the
Chromosome class for details). Outside of SLiMgui, this property still exists,
but is not used by SLiM. Colors may be specified by name, or with hexadecimal
RGB values of the form "#RRGGBB" (see the Eidos manual). If colorSubstitution
is the empty string, "", SLiMgui’s default (selection-coefficient–based) color
scheme is used; this is the default for new MutationType objects.</p></dd>
<dt>convertToSubstitution</dt><dd><p>A property of type string or string or logical
or float or string or float or integer or integer or string or logical or
integer. It is of length one (a singleton). This property is a variable, so
it is modifiable. <strong>Property Description:</strong> This property governs whether
mutations of this mutation type will be converted to Substitution objects
when they reach fixation. In WF models this property is T by default, since
conversion to Substitution objects provides large speed benefits; it should
be set to F only if necessary, and only on the mutation types for which it
is necessary. This might be needed, for example, if you are using a fitness()
callback to implement an epistatic relationship between mutations; a mutation
epistatically influencing the fitness of other mutations through a fitness()
callback would need to continue having that influence even after reaching
fixation, but if the simulation were to replace the fixed mutation with a
Substitution object the mutation would no longer be considered in fitness
calculations (unless the callback explicitly consulted the list of Substitution
objects kept by the simulation). Other script-defined behaviors in fitness(),
interaction(), mateChoice(), modifyChild(), and recombination() callbacks might
also necessitate the disabling of substitution for a given mutation type; this
is an important consideration to keep in mind. See section 21.3 for further
discussion of convertToSubstitution in WF models. In contrast, for nonWF models
this property is F by default, because even mutations with no epistatis or other
indirect fitness effects will continue to influence the survival probabilities
of individuals. For nonWF models, only neutral mutation types with no epistasis
or other side effects can safely be converted to substitutions upon fixation.
When such a pure-neutral mutation type is defined in a nonWF model, this
property should be set to T to tell SLiM that substitution is allowed; this may
have very large positive effects on performance, so it is important to remember
when modeling background neutral mutations. See section 22.5 for further
discussion of convertToSubstitution in nonWF models. SLiM consults this flag
at the end of each generation when deciding whether to substitute each fixed
mutation. If this flag is T, all eligible fixed mutations will be converted at
the end of the current generation, even if they were previously left unconverted
because of the previous value of the flag. Setting this flag to F will prevent
future substitutions, but will not cause any existing Substitution objects to be
converted back into Mutation objects.</p></dd>
<dt>distributionParams</dt><dd><p>A property of type string or string or logical
or float or string or float or integer or integer or string or logical or
integer. This property is a constant, so it is not modifiable. <strong>Property
Description:</strong> The parameters that configure the chosen distribution of fitness
effects. This will be of type string for DFE type "s", and type float for all
other DFE types.</p></dd>
<dt>distributionType</dt><dd><p>A property of type string or string or logical or
float or string or float or integer or integer or string or logical or integer.
It is of length one (a singleton). This property is a constant, so it is not
modifiable. <strong>Property Description:</strong> The type of distribution of fitness
effects; one of "f", "g", "e", "n", "w", or "s" (see section 23.9, above).</p></dd>
<dt>dominanceCoeff</dt><dd><p>A property of type string or string or logical or float
or string or float or integer or integer or string or logical or integer.
It is of length one (a singleton). This property is a variable, so it is
modifiable. <strong>Property Description:</strong> The dominance coefficient used for
mutations of this type when heterozygous. Changing this will normally affect
the fitness values calculated at the end of the current generation; if you
want current fitness values to be affected, you can call SLiMSim’s method
recalculateFitness() – but see the documentation of that method for caveats.
Note that the dominance coefficient is not bounded. A dominance coefficient
greater than 1.0 may be used to achieve an overdominance effect. By making
the selection coefficient very small and the dominance coefficient very large,
an overdominance scenario in which both homozygotes have the same fitness may
be approximated, to a nearly arbitrary degree of precision. Note that this
property has a quirk: it is stored internally in SLiM using a single-precision
float, not the double-precision float type normally used by Eidos. This means
that if you set a mutation type muttype’s dominance coefficient to some number
x, muttype.dominanceCoeff==x may be F due to floating-point rounding error.
Comparisons of floating-point numbers for exact equality is often a bad idea,
but this is one case where it may fail unexpectedly. Instead, it is recommended
to use the id or tag properties to identify particular mutation types.</p></dd>
<dt>id</dt><dd><p>A property of type string or string or logical or float or string or
float or integer or integer or string or logical or integer. It is of length
one (a singleton). This property is a constant, so it is not modifiable.
<strong>Property Description:</strong> The identifier for this mutation type; for
mutation type m3, for example, this is 3.</p></dd>
<dt>mutationStackGroup</dt><dd><p>A property of type string or string or logical or
float or string or float or integer or integer or string or logical or integer.
It is of length one (a singleton). This property is a variable, so it is
modifiable. <strong>Property Description:</strong> The group into which this mutation
type belongs for purposes of mutation stacking policy. This is equal to the
mutation type’s id by default. See mutationStackPolicy, below, for discussion.
In nucleotide-based models, the stacking group for nucleotide-based mutation
types is always -1, and cannot be changed. Non-nucleotide-based mutation types
may also be set to share the -1 stacking group, if they should participate in
the same stacking policy as nucleotide-based mutations, but that would be quite
unusual.</p></dd>
<dt>mutationStackPolicy</dt><dd><p>A property of type string or string or logical
or float or string or float or integer or integer or string or logical or
integer. It is of length one (a singleton). This property is a variable,
so it is modifiable. <strong>Property Description:</strong> This property and the
mutationStackGroup property together govern whether mutations of this mutation
type’s stacking group can "stack” – can occupy the same position in a single
individual. A set of mutation types with the same value for mutationStackGroup
is called a "stacking group”, and all mutation types in a given stacking
group must have the same mutationStackPolicy value, which defines the stacking
behavior of all mutations of the mutation types in the stacking group. In other
words, one stacking group might allow its mutations to stack, while another
stacking group might not, but the policy within each stacking group must be
unambiguous. This property is "s" by default, indicating that mutations in this
stacking group should be allowed to stack without restriction. If the policy is
set to "f", the first mutation of stacking group at a given site is retained;
further mutations of this stacking group at the same site are discarded with
no effect. This can be useful for modeling one-way changes; once a gene is
disabled by a premature stop codon, for example, you might wish to assume, for
simplicity, that further mutations cannot alter that fact. If the policy is set
to "l", the last mutation of this stacking group at a given site is retained;
earlier mutation of this stacking group at the same site are discarded. This
can be useful for modeling an "infinitealleles” scenario in which every new
mutation at a site generates a completely new allele, rather than retaining the
previous mutations at the site. The mutation stacking policy applies only within
the given mutation type’s stacking group; mutations of different stacking groups
are always allowed to stack in SLiM. The policy applies to all mutations added
to the model after the policy is set, whether those mutations are introduced
by calls such as addMutation(), addNewMutation(), or addNewDrawnMutation(), or
are added by SLiM’s own mutation-generation machinery. However, no attempt is
made to enforce the policy for mutations already existing at the time the policy
is set; typically, therefore, the policy is set in an initialize() callback so
that it applies throughout the simulation. The policy is also not enforced upon
the mutations loaded from a file with readFromPopulationFile(); such mutations
were governed by whatever stacking policy was in effect when the population file
was generated. In nucleotide-based models, the stacking policy for nucleotide-
based mutation types is always "l", and cannot be changed. This ensures that new
nucleotide mutations always replace the previous nucleotide at a site, and that
more than one nucleotide mutation is never present at the same position in a
single genome.</p></dd>
<dt>nucleotideBased</dt><dd><p>A property of type string or string or logical or float
or string or float or integer or integer or string or logical or integer.
It is of length one (a singleton). This property is a constant, so it is not
modifiable. <strong>Property Description:</strong> If the mutation type was created with
initializeMutationType(), it is not nucleotide-based, and this property is F.
If it was created with initializeMutationTypeNuc(), it is nucleotide-based, and
this property is T. See those methods for further discussion.</p></dd>
<dt>tag</dt><dd><p>A property of type string or string or logical or float or string
or float or integer or integer or string or logical or integer. It is of
length one (a singleton). This property is a variable, so it is modifiable.
<strong>Property Description:</strong> A user-defined integer value. The value of tag
is initially undefined, and it is an error to try to read it; if you wish it to
have a defined value, you must arrange that yourself by explicitly setting its
value prior to using it elsewhere in your code. The value of tag is not used by
SLiM; it is free for you to use. See also the getValue() and setValue() methods,
for another way of attaching state to mutation types.</p></dd>
