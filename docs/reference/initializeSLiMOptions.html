    <p>Configure options for the simulation. If initializeSLiMOptions()
is called at all then it must be called before any other initialization
function (except initializeSLiMModelType()), so that SLiM knows from the
outset which optional features are enabled and which are not. If keepPedigrees
is T, SLiM will keep pedigree information for every individual in the
simulation, tracking the identity of its parents and grandparents. This
allows individuals to assess their degree of pedigree-based relatedness to
other individuals (see Individual’s relatedness() method, section 23.6.2), as
well as allowing a model to find "trios” (two parents and an offspring they
generated) using the pedigree properties of Individual (section 23.6.1). As
a side effect of keepPedigrees being T, the pedigreeID, pedigreeParentIDs,
and pedigreeGrandparentIDs properties of Individual will have defined values
(see section 23.6.1), as will the genomePedigreeID property of Genome (see
section 23.3.1). Note that pedigree-based relatedness doesn’t necessarily
correspond to genetic relatedness, due to effects such as assortment and
recombination. For an overview of other ways of tracking genetic ancestry,
including true local ancestry at each position on the chromosome, see sections
1.7 and 14.7. If dimensionality is not "", SLiM will enable its optional
"continuous space” facility. Three values for dimensionality are presently
supported: "x", "xy", and "xyz", specifying that continuous space should be
enabled for one, two, or three dimensions, respectively, using (x), (x, y),
and (x, y, z) coordinates respectively. This has a number of side effects.
First of all, it means that the specified properties of Individual (x, y,
and/or z) will be interpreted by SLiM as spatial positions; in particular,
SLiMgui will use those properties to display subpopulations spatially. Second,
it allows spatial interactions to be defined, evaluated, and queried using
initializeInteractionType() and interaction() callbacks. And third, it enables
the use of any other properties and methods related to continuous space, such
as setting the spatial boundaries of subpopulations, which would otherwise
raise an error. If periodicity is not "", SLiM will designate the specified
spatial dimensions as being periodic – wrapping around at the edges of the
spatial boundaries of that dimension. This option may only be used if the
dimensionality parameter to initializeSLiMOptions() has been used to enable
spatiality in the model, and only spatial dimensions that were specified in the
dimensionality of the model may be declared to be periodic (but if desired, it
is permissible to make just a subset of those dimensions periodic; it is not
an all-or-none proposition). For example, if the specified dimensionality is
"xy", the model’s periodicity may be "x", "y", or "xy" (or "", the default,
to specify that there are no periodic dimensions). A one-dimensional periodic
model would model a space like the perimeter of a circle. A two-dimensional
model periodic in one of those dimensions would model a space like a cylinder
without its end caps; if periodic in both dimensions, the modeled space is a
torus. The shapes of three-dimensional periodic models are harder to visualize,
but are essentially higherdimensional analogues of these concepts. Periodic
boundary conditions are commonly used to model spatial scenarios without "edge
effects”, since there are no edges in the periodic spatial dimensions. The
pointPeriodic() method of Subpopulation is typically used in conjunction with
this option, to actually implement the periodic boundary condition for the
specified dimensions. If mutationRuns is not 0, SLiM will use the value given
as the number of mutation runs inside Genome objects; if it is 0 (the default),
SLiM will calculate a number of mutation runs that it estimates will work
well. Internally, SLiM divides genomes into a sequence of consecutive mutation
runs, allowing more efficient internal computations. The optimal mutation
run length is short enough that each mutation run is relatively unlikely to
be modified by mutation/recombination events when inherited, but long enough
that each mutation run is likely to contain a relatively large number of
mutations; these priorities are in tension, so an intermediate balance between
them is generally desirable. The optimal number of mutation runs will depend
upon the machine and even the compiler used to build SLiM, so SLiM’s default
value may not be optimal; for maximal performance it can thus be beneficial to
experiment with different values and find the optimal value for the simulation
– a process which SLiM can assist with (see section 20.4). Specifying the
number of mutation runs is an advanced technique, but in certain cases it can
improve performance significantly. If preventIncidentalSelfing is T, incidental
selfing in hermaphroditic models will be prevented by SLiM. By default (i.e.,
if preventIncidentalSelfing is F), SLiM chooses the first and second parents
in a biparental mating event independently. It is therefore possible for the
same individual to be chosen as both the first and second parent, resulting
in selfing events even when the selfing rate is zero. In many models this
is unimportant, since it happens fairly infrequently and does not have large
consequences. This behavior is SLiM’s default because it is the simplest option,
and produces results that most closely align with simple analytical population
genetics models. However, in some models this selfing can be undesirable and
problematic. In particular, models that involve very high variance in fitness
or very small effective population sizes may see elevated rates of selfing that
substantially influence model results. If preventIncidentalSelfing is set to T,
all such incidental selfing will be prevented (by choosing a new second parent
if the first parent was chosen again). Non-incidental selfing, as requested by
the selfing rate, will still be permitted. Note that if incidental selfing is
prevented, SLiM will hang if it is unable to find a different second parent;
there must always be at least two individuals in the population with non-
zero fitness, and mateChoice() and modifyChild() callbacks must not absolutely
prevent those two individuals from producing viable offspring. Enforcement
of the prohibition on incidental selfing will occur after mateChoice()
callbacks have been called (and thus the default mating weights provided to
mateChoice() callbacks will not exclude the first parent!), but will occur
before modifyChild() callbacks are called (so those callbacks may assume that
the first and second parents are distinct). If nucleotideBased is T, the model
will be nucleotide-based. In this case, auto-generated mutations (i.e., mutation
types used by genomic element types) must be nucleotide-based, and an ancestral
nucleotide sequence must be supplied with initializeAncestralNucleotides().
Nonnucleotide- based mutations may still be used, but may not be referenced by
genomic element types. A mutation rate (or rate map) may not be supplied with
initializeMutationRate(); instead, a hotspot map may (optionally) be supplied
with initializeHotspotMap(). This choice has many consequences across SLiM; see
section 1.8 for further discussion. This function will likely be extended with
further options in the future, added on to the end of the argument list. Using
named arguments with this call is recommended for readability. Note that turning
on optional features may increase the runtime and memory footprint of SLiM.</p>
