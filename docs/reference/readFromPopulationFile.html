<p>Read from a population initialization file, whether in text or binary
format as previously specified to outputFull(), and return the generation
counter value represented by the file's contents (i.e., the generation at which
the file was generated). Although this is most commonly used to set up initial
populations (often in an Eidos event set to run in generation 1, immediately
after simulation initialization), it may be called in any Eidos event; the
current state of all populations will be wiped and replaced by the state in
the file at filePath. All Eidos variables that are of type object and have
element type Subpopulation, Genome, Mutation, Individual, or Substitution will
be removed as a side effect of this method, since all such variables would
refer to objects that no longer exist in the SLiM simulation; if you want to
preserve any of that state, you should output it or save it to a file prior to
this call. New symbols will be defined to refer to the new Subpopulation objects
loaded from the file. If the file being read was written by a version of SLiM
prior to 2.3, then for backward compatibility fitness values will be calculated
immediately for any new subpopulations created by this call, which will trigger
the calling of any activated and applicable fitness() callbacks. When reading
files written by SLiM 2.3 or later, fitness values are not calculated as a
side effect of this call (because the simulation will often need to evaluate
interactions or modify other state prior to doing so). Eidos events fitness()
mateChoice() modifyChild() recombination() interaction() reproduction() 569 In
SLiM 2.3 and later when using the WF model, calling readFromPopulationFile()
from any context other than a late() event causes a warning; calling from a
late() event is almost always correct in WF models, so that fitness values can
be automatically recalculated by SLiM at the usual time in the generation cycle
without the need to force their recalculation (see chapter 22, and comments on
recalculateFitness() below). In SLiM 3.0 when using the nonWF model, calling
readFromPopulationFile() from any context other than an early() event causes a
warning; calling from an early() event is almost always correct in nonWF models,
so that fitness values can be automatically recalculated by SLiM at the usual
time in the generation cycle without the need to force their recalculation (see
chapter 23, and comments on recalculateFitness() below). As of SLiM 2.1, this
method changes the generation counter to the generation read from the file.
If you do not want the generation counter to be changed, you can change it
back after reading, by setting sim.generation to whatever value you wish. Note
that restoring a saved past state and running forward again will not yield the
same simulation results, because the random number generator's state will not
be the same; to ensure reproducibility from a given time point, setSeed() can
be used to establish a new seed value. Any changes made to the simulation's
structure (mutation types, genomic element types, etc.) will not be wiped
and re-established by readFromPopulationFile(); this method loads only the
population's state, not the simulation configuration, so care should be taken
to ensure that the simulation structure meshes coherently with the loaded data.
Indeed, state such as the selfing and cloning rates of subpopulations, values
set into tag properties, and values set onto objects with setValue() will also
be lost, since it is not saved out by outputFull(). Only information saved by
outputFull() will be restored; all other state associated with the simulation's
subpopulations, individuals, genomes, mutations, and substitutions will be lost,
and should be re-established by the model if it is still needed. As of SLiM
2.3, this method will read and restore the spatial positions of individuals if
that information is present in the output file and the simulation has enabled
continuous space (see outputFull() for details). If spatial positions are
present in the output file but the simulation has not enabled continuous space
(or the number of spatial dimensions does not match), an error will result.
If the simulation has enabled continuous space but spatial positions are not
present in the output file, the spatial positions of the individuals read will
be undefined, but an error is not raised. As of SLiM 3.0, this method will read
and restore the ages of individuals if that information is present in the output
file and the simulation is based upon the nonWF model. If ages are present but
the simulation uses a WF model, an error will result; the WF model does not use
age information. If ages are not present but the simulation uses a nonWF model,
an error will also result; the nonWF model requires age information. As of SLiM
3.3, this method will restore the nucleotides of nucleotide-based mutations,
and will restore the ancestral nucleotide sequence, if that information is
present in the output file. Loading an output file that contains nucleotide
information in a non-nucleotide-based model, and vice versa, will produce
an error. As of SLiM 3.5, this method will read and restore the pedigree IDs
of individuals and genomes if that information is present in the output file
(as requested with outputFull(pedigreeIDs=T)) and if SLiM's optional pedigree
tracking has been turned on with initializeSLiMOptions(keepPedigrees=T).
This method can also be used to read tree-sequence (.trees) files saved by
treeSeqOutput() or generated by the Python pyslim package. When loading a tree
sequence, a crosscheck of the loaded data will be performed to ensure that the
tree sequence was well-formed and was loaded correctly. When running a Release
build of SLiM, however, this crosscheck will only occur the first time that
readFromPopulationFile() is called to load a tree sequence; subsequent calls
will not perform this crosscheck, for greater speed when running models that
load saved population state many times (such as models that are conditional on
fixation). If you suspect that a tree sequence file might be corrupted or read
incorrectly, running a Debug build of SLiM enables crosschecks after every load.

<p>Read from a population initialization file, whether in text or binary
format as previously specified to outputFull(), and return the tick counter
value represented by the file's contents (i.e., the tick at which the file was
generated). Although this is most commonly used to set up initial populations
(often in an Eidos event set to run in tick 1, immediately after simulation
initialization), it may be called in any early() or late() Eidos event; the
current state of all populations in the target species will be wiped and
replaced by the state in the file at filePath. All Eidos variables that are of
type object and have element type Subpopulation, Genome, Mutation, Individual,
or Substitution will be removed as a side effect of this method if they contain
any element that belongs to the target species, because those objects will no
longer exist in the SLiM simulation; if you want to preserve any of that state,
you should output it or save it to a file prior to this call. New symbols will
be defined to refer to the new Subpopulation objects loaded from the file. If
the file being read was written by a version of SLiM prior to 2.3, then for
backward compatibility fitness values will be calculated immediately for any
new subpopulations created by this call, which will trigger the calling of any
activated and applicable mutationEffect() and fitnessEffect() callbacks. When
reading files written by SLiM 2.3 or later, fitness values are not calculated as
a side effect of this call (because the simulation will often need to evaluate
interactions or modify other state prior to doing so). In SLiM 2.3 and later
when using the WF model, calling readFromPopulationFile() from any context
other than a late() event causes a warning; calling from a late() event is
almost always correct in WF models, so that fitness values can be automatically
recalculated by SLiM at the usual time in the tick cycle without the need to
force their recalculation (see chapter 22, and comments on recalculateFitness()
below). In SLiM 3.0 when using the nonWF model, calling readFromPopulationFile()
from any context other than an early() event causes a warning; calling from an
early() event is almost always correct in nonWF models, so that fitness values
can be automatically recalculated by SLiM at the usual time in the tick cycle
without the need to force their recalculation (see chapter 23, and comments
on recalculateFitness() below). As of SLiM 2.1, this method changes the tick
and cycle counters to the tick and cycle read from the file. If you do not
want these counters to be changed, you can change them back after reading,
by setting community.tick and sim.cycle to whatever values you wish. Note
that restoring a saved past state and running forward again will not yield
the same simulation results, because the random number generator's state will
not be the same; to ensure reproducibility from a given time point, setSeed()
can be used to establish a new seed value. Any changes made to structure of
the species (mutation types, genomic element types, etc.) will not be wiped
and re-established by readFromPopulationFile(); this method loads only the
population's state, not the species configuration, so care should be taken
to ensure that the species structure meshes coherently with the loaded data.
Indeed, state such as the selfing and cloning rates of subpopulations, values
set into tag properties, and values set onto objects with setValue() will also
be lost, since it is not saved out by outputFull(). Only information saved by
outputFull() will be restored; all other state associated with the species -
subpopulations, individuals, genomes, mutations, and substitutions - will be
lost, and should be re-established by the model if it is still needed. As of
SLiM 2.3, this method will read and restore the spatial positions of individuals
if that information is present in the output file and the species has enabled
continuous space (see outputFull() for details). If spatial positions are
present in the output file but the species has not enabled continuous space
(or the number of spatial dimensions does not match), an error will result. If
the species has enabled continuous space but spatial positions are not present
in the output file, the spatial positions of the individuals read will be
undefined, but an error is not raised. As of SLiM 3.0, this method will read
and restore the ages of individuals if that information is present in the output
file and the simulation is based upon the nonWF model. If ages are present but
the simulation uses a WF model, an error will result; the WF model does not use
age information. If ages are not present but the simulation uses a nonWF model,
an error will also result; the nonWF model requires age information. As of SLiM
3.3, this method will restore the nucleotides of nucleotide-based mutations, and
will restore the ancestral nucleotide sequence, if that information is present
in the output file. Loading an output file that contains nucleotide information
in a non-nucleotide-based model, and vice versa, will produce an error. As of
SLiM 3.5, this method will read and restore the pedigree IDs of individuals and
genomes if that information is present in the output file (as requested with
outputFull(pedigreeIDs=T)) and if SLiM's optional pedigree tracking has been
enabled with initializeSLiMOptions(keepPedigrees=T). This method can also be
used to read tree-sequence (.trees) files saved by treeSeqOutput() or generated
by the Python pyslim package. Beginning with SLiM 4, the subpopMap parameter may
be supplied to re-order the populations of the input tree sequence when it is
loaded in to SLiM. This parameter must have a value that is a Dictionary; the
keys of this dictionary should be SLiM population identifiers as string values
(e.g., "p2"), and the values should be indexes of populations in the input
tree sequence; a key/value pair of "p2", 4 would mean that the fifth population
in the input (the one at zero-based index 4) should become p2 on loading into
SLiM. If subpopMap is non- NULL, all populations in the tree sequence must be
explicitly mapped, even if their index will not change and even if they will not
be used by SLiM; the only exception is for unused slots in the population table,
which can be explicitly remapped but do not have to be. For instance, suppose
we have a tree sequence in which population 0 is unused, population 1 is not a
SLiM population (for example, an ancestral population produced by msprime), and
population 2 is a SLiM population, and we want to load this in with population 2
as p0 in SLiM. To do this, we could supply a value of Dictionary("p0", 2, "p1",
1, "p2", 0) for subpopMap, or we could leave out slot 0 since it is unused,
with Dictionary("p0", 2, "p1", 1). Although this facility cannot be used to
remove populations in the tree sequence, note that it may add populations that
will be visible when treeSeqOutput() is called (although these will not be SLiM
populations); if, in this example, we had used Dictionary("p0", 0, "p1", 1,
"p5", 2) and then we wrote the result out with treeSeqOutput(), the resulting
tree sequence would have six populations, although three of them would be empty
and would not be used by SLiM. The use of subpopMap makes it easier to load
simulation data that was generated in Python, since that typically uses an
id of 0. The subpopMap parameter may not be used with file formats other than
tree-sequence files, at the present time; setting up the correct subpopulation
ids is typically easier when working with those other formats. Note the
tskit command-line interface can be used, like python3 -m tskit populations
file.trees, to find out the number of subpopulations in a tree-sequence file and
their IDs. When loading a tree sequence, a crosscheck of the loaded data will
be performed to ensure that the tree sequence was well-formed and was loaded
correctly. When running a Release build of SLiM, however, this crosscheck will
only occur the first time that readFromPopulationFile() is called to load a tree
sequence; subsequent calls will not perform this crosscheck, for greater speed
when running models that load saved population state many times (such as models
that are conditional on fixation). If you suspect that a tree sequence file
might be corrupted or read incorrectly, running a Debug build of SLiM enables
crosschecks after every load.</p>
