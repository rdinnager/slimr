    <p>Read from a population initialization file, whether in text or binary
format as previously specified to outputFull(), and return the generation
counter value represented by the file’s contents (i.e., the generation at which
the file was generated). Although this is most commonly used to set up initial
populations (often in an Eidos event set to run in generation 1, immediately
after simulation initialization), it may be called in any Eidos event; the
current state of all populations will be wiped and replaced by the state in
the file at filePath. All Eidos variables that are of type object and have
element type Subpopulation, Genome, Mutation, Individual, or Substitution will
be removed as a side effect of this method, since all such variables would
refer to objects that no longer exist in the SLiM simulation; if you want to
preserve any of that state, you should output it or save it to a file prior
to this call. New symbols will be defined to refer to the new Subpopulation
objects loaded from the file. If the file being read was written by a version
of SLiM prior to 2.3, then for backward compatibility fitness values will be
calculated immediately for any new subpopulations created by this call, which
will trigger the calling of any activated and applicable fitness() callbacks.
When reading files written by SLiM 2.3 or later, fitness values are not
calculated as a side effect of this call (because the simulation will often
need to evaluate interactions or modify other state prior to doing so). In SLiM
2.3 and later when using the WF model, calling readFromPopulationFile() from
any context other than a late() event causes a warning; calling from a late()
event is almost always correct in WF models, so that fitness values can be
automatically recalculated by SLiM at the usual time in the generation cycle
without the need to force their recalculation (see chapter 21, and comments on
recalculateFitness() below). In SLiM 3.0 when using the nonWF model, calling
readFromPopulationFile() from any context other than an early() event causes a
warning; calling from an early() event is almost always correct in nonWF models,
so that fitness values can be automatically recalculated by SLiM at the usual
time in the generation cycle without the need to force their recalculation (see
chapter 22, and comments on recalculateFitness() below). As of SLiM 2.1, this
method changes the generation counter to the generation read from the file.
If you do not want the generation counter to be changed, you can change it
back after reading, by setting sim.generation to whatever value you wish. Note
that restoring a saved past state and running forward again will not yield the
same simulation results, because the random number generator’s state will not
be the same; to ensure reproducibility from a given time point, setSeed() can
be used to establish a new seed value. Any changes made to the simulation’s
structure (mutation types, genomic element types, etc.) will not be wiped
and re-established by readFromPopulationFile(); this method loads only the
population’s state, not the simulation configuration, so care should be taken
to ensure that the simulation structure meshes coherently with the loaded data.
Indeed, state such as the selfing and cloning rates of subpopulations, values
set into tag properties, and values set onto objects with setValue() will also
be lost, since it is not saved out by outputFull(). Only information saved by
outputFull() will be restored; all other state associated with the simulation’s
subpopulations, individuals, genomes, mutations, and substitutions will be lost,
and should be re-established by the model if it is still needed. As of SLiM
2.3, this method will read and restore the spatial positions of individuals if
that information is present in the output file and the simulation has enabled
continuous space (see outputFull() for details). If spatial positions are
present in the output file but the simulation has not enabled continuous space
(or the number of spatial dimensions does not match), an error will result.
If the simulation has enabled continuous space but spatial positions are not
present in the output file, the spatial positions of the individuals read will
be undefined, but an error is not raised. As of SLiM 3.0, this method will read
and restore the ages of individuals if that information is present in the output
file and the simulation is based upon the nonWF model. If ages are present but
the simulation uses a WF model, an error will result; the WF model does not use
age information. If ages are not present but the simulation uses a nonWF model,
an error will also result; the nonWF model requires age information. As of SLiM
3.3, this method will restore the nucleotides of nucleotide-based mutations, and
will restore the ancestral nucleotide sequence, if that information is present
in the output file. Loading an output file that contains nucleotide information
in a non-nucleotide-based model, and vice versa, will produce an error.
This method can also be used to read tree-sequence (.trees) files saved by
treeSeqOutput() or generated by the Python pyslim package. When loading a tree
sequence, a crosscheck of the loaded data will be performed to ensure that the
tree sequence was well-formed and was loaded correctly. When running a Release
build of SLiM, however, this crosscheck will only occur the first time that
readFromPopulationFile() is called to load a tree sequence; subsequent calls
will not perform this crosscheck, for greater speed when running models that
load saved population state many times (such as models that are conditional on
fixation). If you suspect that a tree sequence file might be corrupted or read
incorrectly, running a Debug build of SLiM enables crosschecks after every load.</p>
