Documentation for GenomicElementType class from SLiM

\details{
This class has the following methods (functions):
\itemize{
\item{\code{\link{getValue}}}
\item{\code{\link{setMutationFractions}}}
\item{\code{\link{setMutationMatrix}}}
\item{\code{\link{setValue}}}
}
This class has the following properties:
\describe{
\item{color}{A property of type string. It is of length one (a singleton). This
property is a variable, so it is modifiable. \strong{Property Description:}
The color used to display genomic elements of this type in SLiMgui. Outside
of SLiMgui, this property still exists, but is not used by SLiM. Colors may be
specified by name, or with hexadecimal RGB values of the form "#RRGGBB" (see the
Eidos manual). If color is the empty string, "", SLiMguiâ€™s default color scheme
is used; this is the default for new GenomicElementType objects. }
\item{id}{A property of type integer. It is of length one (a singleton). This
property is a constant, so it is not modifiable. \strong{Property Description:}
The identifier for this genomic element type; for genomic element type g3, for
example, this is 3. }
\item{mutationFractions}{A property of type float. This property is a constant,
so it is not modifiable. \strong{Property Description:} For each MutationType
represented in this genomic element type, this property has the corresponding
fraction of all mutations that will be drawn from that MutationType. }
\item{mutationMatrix}{A property of type float. This property is a
constant, so it is not modifiable. \strong{Property Description:} The
nucleotide mutation matrix used for this genomic element type, set up by
initializeGenomicElementType() and setMutationMatrix(). This property is only
defined in nucleotide-based models; it is unavailable otherwise. }
\item{mutationTypes}{A property of type MutationType object. This property
is a constant, so it is not modifiable. \strong{Property Description:} The
MutationType instances used by this genomic element type. }
\item{tag}{A property of type integer. It is of length one (a singleton). This
property is a variable, so it is modifiable. \strong{Property Description:}
A user-defined integer value. The value of tag is initially undefined, and
it is an error to try to read it; if you wish it to have a defined value, you
must arrange that yourself by explicitly setting its value prior to using it
elsewhere in your code. The value of tag is not used by SLiM; it is free for
you to use. See also the getValue() and setValue() methods, for another way of
attaching state to genomic element types.}
