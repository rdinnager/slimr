\description{
Documentation for SLiM function \code{addCloned}, which is a method of the SLiM
class \code{\link{Subpopulation}}.
Note that the R function is a stub, it does not do anything in R (except bring
up this documentation). It will only do
anything useful when used inside a \code{\link{slim_block}} function further
nested in a \code{\link{slim_script}}
function call, where it will be translated into valid SLiM code as part of a
full SLiM script.

Documentation for this function can be found in the official
\href{http://benhaller.com/slim/SLiM_Manual.pdf#page=732}{SLiM manual: page
732}.

Generates a new offspring individual from the given parent by
clonal reproduction, queues it for addition to the target subpopulation, and
returns it. The new offspring will not be visible as a member of the target
subpopulation until the end of the offspring generation tick cycle stage.
The subpopulation of parent will be used to locate applicable mutation() and
modifyChild() callbacks governing the generation of the offspring individual.
Beginning in SLiM 4.1, the count parameter dictates how many offspring will
be generated (previously, exactly one offspring was generated). Each offspring
is generated independently, based upon the given parameters. The returned
vector contains all generated offspring, except those that were rejected by a
modifyChild() callback. If all offspring are rejected, object<Individual>(0)
is returned, which is a zero-length object vector of class Individual; note
that this is a change in behavior from earlier versions, which would return
NULL. Beginning in SLiM 4.1, passing T for defer will defer the generation
of the genomes of the produced offspring until the end of the reproduction
phase. Genome generation can only be deferred if there are no active mutation()
callbacks; otherwise, an error will result. Furthermore, when genome generation
is deferred the mutations of the genomes of the generated offspring may not be
accessed until reproduction is complete (whether from a modifyChild() callback
or otherwise). There is little or no advantage to deferring genome generation
at this time (it is in place for future expansion); the default of F for defer
is generally preferable since it has fewer restrictions. Also beginning in SLiM
4.1, in spatial models the spatial position of the offspring will be inherited
(i.e., copied) from parent; more specifically, the x property will be inherited
in all spatial models (1D/ 2D/3D), the y property in 2D/3D models, and the z
property in 3D models. Properties not inherited will be left uninitialized,
as they were prior to SLiM 4.1. The parent's spatial position is probably not
desirable in itself; the intention here is to make it easy to model the natal
dispersal of all the new offspring for a given tick with a single vectorized
call to pointDeviated(). Note that this method is only for use in nonWF models.
See addCrossed() for further general notes on the addition of new offspring
individuals.
