for description.}

\description{
Documentation for SLiM function \code{blend}, which is a method of the SLiM
class \code{\link{SpatialMap}}.
Note that the R function is a stub, it does not do anything in R (except bring
up this documentation). It will only do
anything useful when used inside a \code{\link{slim_block}} function further
nested in a \code{\link{slim_script}}
function call, where it will be translated into valid SLiM code as part of a
full SLiM script.

Documentation for this function can be found in the official
\href{http://benhaller.com/slim/SLiM_Manual.pdf#page=713}{SLiM manual: page
713}.

Blends x into the spatial map, giving x a weight of xFraction and the
existing values in the target spatial map a weight of 1 - xFraction, such that
the resulting values in the target spatial map are then given by x * xFraction
+ target * (1 - xFraction). The value of xFraction must be in [0.0, 1.0]. One
possibility is that x is a singleton integer or float value; in this case, x
is blended with each grid value of the target spatial map. Another possibility
is that x is an integer or float vector/ matrix/array of the same dimensions
as the target spatial map's grid; in this case, each value of x is blended with
the corresponding grid value of the target spatial map. The third possibility
is that x is itself a (singleton) spatial map; in this case, each grid value of
x is blended with the corresponding grid value of the target spatial map (and
thus the two spatial maps must match in their spatiality, their spatial bounds,
and their grid dimensions). The target spatial map is returned, to allow easy
chaining of operations.
