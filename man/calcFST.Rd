\description{
Documentation for SLiM function \code{calcFST}, which is a method of the SLiM
class \code{\link{SLiMBuiltin}}.
Note that the R function is a stub, it does not do anything in R (except bring
up this documentation). It will only do
anything useful when used inside a \code{\link{slim_block}} function further
nested in a \code{\link{slim_script}}
function call, where it will be translated into valid SLiM code as part of a
full SLiM script.

Documentation for this function can be found in the official \href{http://

Calculates the FST between two Genome vectors - typically, but not
necessarily, the genomes that constitute two different subpopulations (which
we will assume for the purposes of this discussion). In general, higher FST
indicates greater genetic divergence between subpopulations. The calculation
is done using only the mutations in muts; if muts is NULL, all mutations
are used. The muts parameter can therefore be used to calculate the FST only
for a particular mutation type (by passing only mutations of that type). The
calculation can be narrowed to apply to only a window - a subrange of the
full chromosome - by passing the interval bounds [start, end] for the desired
window. In this case, the vector of mutations used for the calculation will
be subset to include only mutations within the specified window. The default
behavior, with start and end of NULL, provides the genome-wide FST, which
is often used to assess the overall level of genetic divergence between
sister species or allopatric subpopulations. The code for calcFST() is just
an Eidos implementation of Wright's definition of FST: where is the average
heterozygosity in the two subpopulations, and is the total heterozygosity
when both subpopulations are combined. In this implementation, the two genome
vectors are weighted equally, not weighted by their size. The implementation
of calcFST(), viewable with functionSource(), treats every mutation in muts
as independent in the heterozygosity calculations. If mutations are stacked,
the heterozygosity calculated is by mutation, not by site. Similarly, if
multiple Mutation objects exist in different genomes at the same site (whether
representing different genetic states, or multiple mutational lineages for the
same genetic state), each Mutation object is treated separately for purposes
of the heterozygosity calculation, just as if they were at different sites.
One could regard these choices as embodying an infinite-sites interpretation
of the segregating mutations. In most biologically realistic models, such
genetic states will be quite rare, and so the impact of these choices will be
negligible; however, in some models these distinctions may be important. It is
also worth noting that mutations that are at a frequency of 0.0 or 1.0 across
the two subpopulations are excluded from the calculation, because for such
mutations is zero and the result is therefore undefined.
