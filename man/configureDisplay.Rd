\description{
Documentation for SLiM function \code{configureDisplay}, which is a method of
the SLiM class \code{Subpopulation}.
Note that the R function is a stub, it does not do anything in R (except bring
up this documentation). It will only do
anything useful when used inside a \code{\link{slim_block}} function further
nested in a \code{\link{slim_script}}
function call, where it will be translated into valid SLiM code as part of a
full SLiM script.

\details{
This method customizes the display of the subpopulation in SLiMgui’s
Population Visualization graph. When this method is called by a model running
outside SLiMgui, it will do nothing except typechecking and bounds-checking
its arguments. When called by a model running in SLiMgui, the position,
size, and color of the subpopulation’s displayed circle can be controlled as
specified below. The center parameter sets the coordinates of the center of
the subpopulation’s displayed circle; it must be a float vector of length two,
such that center[0] provides the x-coordinate and center[1] provides the y-
coordinate. The square central area of the Population Visualization occupies
scaled coordinates in [0,1] for both x and y, so the values in center must
be within those bounds. If a value of NULL is provided, SLiMgui’s default
center will be used (which currently arranges subpopulations in a circle).
The scale parameter sets a scaling factor to be applied to the radius of the
subpopulation’s displayed circle. The default radius used by SLiMgui is a
function of the subpopulation’s number of individuals; this default radius is
then multiplied by scale. If a value of NULL is provided, the default radius
will be used; this is equivalent to supplying a scale of 1.0. Typically the
same scale value should be used by all subpopulations, to scale all of their
circles up or down uniformly, but that is not required. The color parameter
sets the color to be used for the displayed subpopulation’s circle. Colors may
be specified by name, or with hexadecimal RGB values of the form "#RRGGBB" (see
the Eidos manual). If color is NULL or the empty string, "", SLiMgui’s default
(fitness-based) color will be used.
