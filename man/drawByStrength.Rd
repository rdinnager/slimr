\usage{
drawByStrength(receiver, count, exerterSubpop)
}
\arguments{
\item{receiver}{An object of type Individual object. Must be of length 1 (a
singleton). See details for description.}

\item{count}{An object of type integer. Must be of length 1 (a singleton). The
default value is \code{1}. See details for description.}

\item{exerterSubpop}{An object of type null or Subpopulation object. Must be
of length 1 (a singleton). The default value is \code{NULL}. See details for
description.}
}
\value{
An object of type Individual object.

\description{
Documentation for SLiM function \code{drawByStrength}, which is a method of the
SLiM class \code{\link{InteractionType}}.
Note that the R function is a stub, it does not do anything in R (except bring
up this documentation). It will only do
anything useful when used inside a \code{\link{slim_block}} function further
nested in a \code{\link{slim_script}}
function call, where it will be translated into valid SLiM code as part of a
full SLiM script.

Documentation for this function can be found in the official
\href{http://benhaller.com/slim/SLiM_Manual.pdf#page=660}{SLiM manual: page
660}.

Returns up to count individuals drawn from exerterSubpop, or if that
is NULL (the default), then from the subpopulation of receiver. The probability
of drawing particular individuals is proportional to the strength of interaction
they exert upon receiver. All exerters must belong to a single subpopulation
(but not necessarily the same subpopulation as receiver). The evaluate() method
must have been previously called for the receiver and exerter subpopulations,
and positions saved at evaluation time will be used. This method may be used
with either spatial or non-spatial interactions, but will be more efficient
with spatial interactions that set a short maximum interaction distance. Draws
are done with replacement, so the same individual may be drawn more than once;
sometimes using unique() on the result of this call is therefore desirable. If
more than one draw will be needed, it is much more efficient to use a single
call to drawByStrength(), rather than drawing individuals one at a time. Note
that if no individuals exert a non-zero interaction strength upon receiver,
the vector returned will be zero- length; it is important to consider this
possibility.
