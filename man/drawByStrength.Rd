Documentation for SLiM function \code{drawByStrength}, which is a method of the
SLiM class \code{\link{InteractionType}}.
Note that the R function is a stub, it does not do anything in R (except bring
up this documentation). It will only do
anything useful when used inside a \code{\link{slim_block}} function further
nested in a \code{\link{slim_script}}
function call, where it will be translated into valid SLiM code as part of a
full SLiM script.

692}.

Returns an object<Individual> vector containing up to count individuals
drawn from exerterSubpop, or if that is NULL (the default), then from the
subpopulation of receiver, which must be singleton in the default mode of
operation (but see below). The probability of drawing particular individuals is
proportional to the strength of interaction they exert upon receiver (which is
zero for receiver itself). All exerters must belong to a single subpopulation
(but not necessarily the same subpopulation as receiver). The evaluate() method
must have been previously called for the receiver and exerter subpopulations,
and positions saved at evaluation time will be used. This method may be used
with either spatial or non-spatial interactions, but will be more efficient
with spatial interactions that set a short maximum interaction distance.
Draws are done with replacement, so the same individual may be drawn more
than once; sometimes using unique() on the result of this call is therefore
desirable. If more than one draw will be needed, it is much more efficient
to use a single call to drawByStrength(), rather than drawing individuals one
at a time. Note that if no individuals exert a non-zero interaction strength
upon receiver, the vector returned will be zerolength; it is important to
consider this possibility. Beginning in SLiM 4.1, this method has a vectorized
mode of operation in which the receiver parameter may be non-singleton. To
switch the method to this mode, pass T for returnDict, rather than the default
of F (the operation of which is described above). In this mode, the return
value is a Dictionary object instead of a vector of Individual objects. This
dictionary uses integer keys that range from 0 to N-1, where N is the number
of individuals passed in receiver; these keys thus correspond directly to the
indices of the individuals in receiver, and there is one entry in the dictionary
for each receiver. The value in the dictionary, for a given integer key, is
an object<Individual> vector with the individuals drawn for the corresponding
receiver, exactly as described above for the non-vectorized case. The results
for each receiver can therefore be obtained from the returned dictionary
with getValue(), passing the index of the receiver. The speed of this mode
of operation will probably be similar to the speed of making N separate
non-vectorized calls to drawByStrength(), but may have other advantages. In this
mode of operation, all receivers must belong to the same subpopulation.
