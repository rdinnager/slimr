\title{SLiM method nearestInteractingNeighbors}
\usage{
nearestInteractingNeighbors(receiver, count, exerterSubpop)
}
\arguments{
\item{receiver}{An object of type Individual object. Must be of length 1 (a
singleton). See details for description.}

\item{count}{An object of type integer. Must be of length 1 (a singleton). The
default value is \code{1}. See details for description.}

\item{exerterSubpop}{An object of type null or Subpopulation object. Must be
of length 1 (a singleton). The default value is \code{NULL}. See details for
description.}
}
\value{
An object of type Individual object.

\description{
Documentation for SLiM function \code{nearestInteractingNeighbors}, which is a
method of the SLiM class \code{\link{InteractionType}}.
Note that the R function is a stub, it does not do anything in R (except bring
up this documentation). It will only do
anything useful when used inside a \code{\link{slim_block}} function further
nested in a \code{\link{slim_script}}
function call, where it will be translated into valid SLiM code as part of a
full SLiM script.

Documentation for this function can be found in the official
\href{http://benhaller.com/slim/SLiM_Manual.pdf#page=662}{SLiM manual: page
662}.

Returns up to count interacting individuals that are spatially closest
to receiver, according to the distance metric of the InteractionType, from
among the exerters in exerterSubpop (or, if that is NULL, then from among all
individuals in the receiver's subpopulation). More specifically, this method
returns only individuals which can exert an interaction upon the receiver.
To obtain all of the interacting individuals within the maximum interaction
distance of individual, simply pass a value for count that is greater than or
equal to the size of the exerter subpopulation. Note that if fewer than count
interacting individuals are within the maximum interaction distance, the vector
returned may be shorter than count, or even zero-length; it is important to
check for this possibility even when requesting a single neighbor. If only the
number of interacting individuals is needed, use interactingNeighborCount()
instead. The evaluate() method must have been previously called for the receiver
and exerter subpopulations, and positions saved at evaluation time will be
used. If the InteractionType is non-spatial, this method may not be called.
Note that this method uses interaction eligibility as a criterion; it will not
return neighbors that cannot exert an interaction upon the receiver (due to
sex-segregation, e.g.). (It will also never return the receiver as a neighbor of
itself.) To find all neighbors of the receiver, whether they can interact with
it or not, use nearestNeighbors().
