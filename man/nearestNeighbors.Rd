\title{SLiM method nearestNeighbors}
\usage{
nearestNeighbors(receiver, count, exerterSubpop)
}
\arguments{
\item{receiver}{An object of type Individual object. Must be of length 1 (a
singleton). See details for description.}

\item{count}{An object of type integer. Must be of length 1 (a singleton). The
default value is \code{1}. See details for description.}

\item{exerterSubpop}{An object of type null or Subpopulation object. Must be
of length 1 (a singleton). The default value is \code{NULL}. See details for
description.}
}
\value{
An object of type Individual object.

\description{
Documentation for SLiM function \code{nearestNeighbors}, which is a method of
the SLiM class \code{\link{InteractionType}}.
Note that the R function is a stub, it does not do anything in R (except bring
up this documentation). It will only do
anything useful when used inside a \code{\link{slim_block}} function further
nested in a \code{\link{slim_script}}
function call, where it will be translated into valid SLiM code as part of a
full SLiM script.

\details{
Documentation for this function can be found in the official
\href{http://benhaller.com/slim/SLiM_Manual.pdf#page=663}{SLiM manual: page
663}.

Returns up to count individuals that are spatially closest to
individual, according to the distance metric of the InteractionType, from
among the exerters in exerterSubpop (or, if that is NULL, then from among all
individuals in the receiver's subpopulation). To obtain all of the individuals
within the maximum interaction distance of individual, simply pass a value for
count that is greater than or equal to the size of individual's subpopulation.
Note that if fewer than count individuals are within the maximum interaction
distance, the vector returned may be shorter than count, or even zero- length;
it is important to check for this possibility even when requesting a single
neighbor. The evaluate() method must have been previously called for the
receiver and exerter subpopulations, and positions saved at evaluation time will
be used. If the InteractionType is non-spatial, this method may not be called.
Note that this method does not use interaction eligibility as a criterion;
it will return neighbors that could not interact with the receiver due to
sex-segregation. (It will never return the receiver as a neighbor of itself,
however.) To find only neighbors that are eligible to exert an interaction upon
the receiver, use nearestInteractingNeighbors().
