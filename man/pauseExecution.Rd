\description{
Documentation for SLiM function \code{pauseExecution}, which is a method of the
SLiM class \code{\link{SLiMgui}}.
Note that the R function is a stub, it does not do anything in R (except bring
up this documentation). It will only do
anything useful when used inside a \code{\link{slim_block}} function further
nested in a \code{\link{slim_script}}
function call, where it will be translated into valid SLiM code as part of a
full SLiM script.

Documentation for this function can be found in the official
\href{http://benhaller.com/slim/SLiM_Manual.pdf#page=711}{SLiM manual: page
711}.

Pauses a model that is playing in SLiMgui. This is essentially
equivalent to clicking the "Play" button to stop the execution of the model.
Execution can be resumed by the user, by clicking the "Play" button again;
unlike calling stop() or simulationFinished(), the simulation is not terminated.
This method can be useful for debugging or exploratory purposes, to pause the
model at a point of interest. Execution is paused at the end of the currently
executing tick, not mid-tick. If the model is being profiled, or is executing
forward to a tick number entered in the tick field, pauseExecution() will do
nothing; by design, pauseExecution() only pauses execution when SLiMgui is doing
a simple "Play" of the model.
