\description{
Documentation for SLiM function \code{sampleNearbyPoint}, which is a method of
the SLiM class \code{\link{SpatialMap}}.
Note that the R function is a stub, it does not do anything in R (except bring
up this documentation). It will only do
anything useful when used inside a \code{\link{slim_block}} function further
nested in a \code{\link{slim_script}}
function call, where it will be translated into valid SLiM code as part of a
full SLiM script.

Documentation for this function can be found in the official
\href{http://benhaller.com/slim/SLiM_Manual.pdf#page=716}{SLiM manual: page
716}.

For a spatial point supplied in point, returns a nearby point sampled
from a kernel weighted by the spatial map's values. Only points within the
maximum distance of the kernel, maxDistance, will be chosen, and the probability
that a given point is chosen will be proportional to the density of the kernel
at that point multiplied by the value of the map at that point (interpolated,
if interpolation is enabled for the map). Negative values of the map will be
treated as zero. The point returned will be within spatial bounds, respecting
periodic boundaries if in effect (so there is no need to call pointPeriodic() on
the result). The kernel is specified with a kernel shape, functionType, followed
by zero or more ellipsis arguments; see smooth() for further information.
For this method, at present only kernel types "f", "l", "e", "n", and "t" are
supported, and type "t" is not presently supported for 3D kernels. This method
can be used to find points in the vicinity of individuals that are favorable
- possessing more resources, or better environmental conditions, etc. It can
also be used to guide the dispersal or foraging behavior of individuals. See
sampleImprovedNearbyPoint() for a variant that may be useful for directed
movement across a landscape. Note that the algorithm for sampleNearbyPoint()
works by rejection sampling, and so will be very inefficient if the maximum
value of the map (anywhere, across the entire map) is much larger than
the typical value of the map where individuals are. The algorithm for
sampleImprovedNearbyPoint() is different, and does not exhibit this performance
issue.
