\description{
Documentation for SLiM function \code{setAncestralNucleotides}, which is a
method of the SLiM class \code{\link{Chromosome}}.
Note that the R function is a stub, it does not do anything in R (except bring
up this documentation). It will only do
anything useful when used inside a \code{\link{slim_block}} function further
nested in a \code{\link{slim_script}}
function call, where it will be translated into valid SLiM code as part of a
full SLiM script.

Documentation for this function can be found in the official
\href{http://benhaller.com/slim/SLiM_Manual.pdf#page=633}{SLiM manual: page
633}.

This method, which may be called only in nucleotide-based models
(see section 1.8), replaces the ancestral nucleotide sequence for the
model. The sequence parameter is interpreted exactly as it is in the
initializeAncestralSequence() function; see that documentation for details
(section 24.1). The length of the ancestral sequence is returned. It is unusual
to replace the ancestral sequence in a running simulation, since the nucleotide
states of segregating and fixed mutations will depend upon the original
ancestral sequence. It can be useful when loading a new population state with
readFromMS() or readFromVCF(), such as when resetting the simulation state to an
earlier state in a conditional simulation; however, that is more commonly done
using readFromPopulationFile() with a SLiM or .trees file.
