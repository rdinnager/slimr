\description{
Documentation for SLiM function \code{setConstraints}, which is a method of the
SLiM class \code{\link{InteractionType}}.
Note that the R function is a stub, it does not do anything in R (except bring
up this documentation). It will only do
anything useful when used inside a \code{\link{slim_block}} function further
nested in a \code{\link{slim_script}}
function call, where it will be translated into valid SLiM code as part of a
full SLiM script.

Documentation for this function can be found in the official

697}.

Sets constraints upon which individuals can be receivers and/or
exerters, making the target InteractionType measure interactions between
only subsets of the population. The parameter who specifies upon whom the
specified constraints apply; it may be "exerters" to set constraints upon
exerters, "receivers" to set constraints upon receivers, or "both" to set
constraints upon both. If "both" is used, the same constraints are set for
both exerters and receivers; different constraints can be set for exerters
versus receivers by making a separate call to setConstraints() for each.
Constraints only affect queries that involve the concept of interaction; for
example, they will affect the result of nearestInteractingNeighbors(), but not
the result of nearestNeighbors(). The constraints specified by a given call
to setConstraints() override all previously set constraints for the category
specified (receivers, exerter, or both). There is a general policy for the
remaining arguments: they are NULL by default, and if NULL is used, it specifies
"no constraint" for that property (removing any currently existing constraint
for that property). The sex parameter constrains the sex of individuals; it may
be "M" or "F" (or "*" as another way of specifying no constraint, for historical
reasons). If sex is "M" or "F", the individuals to which the constraint is
applied (potential receivers/exerters) must belong to a sexual species. The
tag parameter constrains the tag property of individuals; if this set, the
individuals to which the constraint is applied must have defined tag values. The
minAge and maxAge properties constrain the age property of individuals to the
given minimum and/or maximum values; these constraints can only be used in nonWF
models. The migrant property constraints the migrant property of individuals
(T constrains to only migrants, F to only non-migrants). Finally, the tagL0,
tagL1, tagL2, tagL3, and tagL4 properties constrain the corresponding logical
properties of individuals, requiring them to be either T or F as specified;
the individuals to which these constraints are applied must have defined values
for the constrained property or properties. Again, NULL should be supplied
(as it is by default) for any property which you do not wish to constrain.
These constraints may be used in any combination, as desired. For example,
calling setConstraints("receivers", sex="M", minAge=5, tagL0=T) constrains
the interaction type's operation so that receivers must be males, with an age
of at least 5, with a tagL0 property value of T. For that configuration the
potential receivers used with the interaction type must be sexual (since sex is
specified), must be in a nonWF model (since minAge is specified), and must have
a defined value for their tagL0 property (since that property is constrained).
Note that the sexSegregation parameter to initializeInteractionType()
is a shortcut which does the same thing as the corresponding calls to
setConstraints(). Exerter constraints are applied at evaluate() time, whereas
receiver constraints are applied at query time; see the InteractionType class
documentation (section 25.8) for further discussion. The interaction constraints
for an interaction type are normally a constant in simulations; in any case,
they cannot be changed when an interaction has already been evaluated, so either
they should be set prior to evaluation, or unevaluate() should be called first.
