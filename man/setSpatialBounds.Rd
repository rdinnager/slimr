Documentation for SLiM function \code{setSpatialBounds}, which is a method of
the SLiM class \code{Subpopulation}.
Note that the R function is a stub, it does not do anything in R (except bring
up this documentation). It will only do
anything useful when used inside a \code{\link{slim_block}} function further
nested in a \code{\link{slim_script}}
function call, where it will be translated into valid SLiM code as part of a
full SLiM script.

\details{
Set the spatial boundaries of the subpopulation to bounds. This
method may be called only for simulations in which continuous space has been
enabled with initializeSLiMOptions(). The length of bounds must be double the
spatial dimensionality, so that it supplies both minimum and maximum values
for each coordinate. More specifically, for a dimensionality of "x", bounds
should supply (x0, x1) values; for dimensionality "xy" it should supply (x0,
y0, x1, y1) values; and for dimensionality "xyz" it should supply (x0, y0,
z0, x1, y1, z1) (in that order). These boundaries will be used by SLiMgui to
calibrate the display of the subpopulation, and will be used by methods such
as pointInBounds(), pointReflected(), pointStopped(), and pointUniform(). The
default spatial boundaries for all subpopulations span the interval [0,1] in
each dimension. Spatial dimensions that are periodic (as established with the
periodicity parameter to initializeSLiMOptions()) must have a minimum coordinate
value of 0.0 (a restriction that allows the handling of periodicity to be
somewhat more efficient). The current spatial bounds for the subpopulation may
be obtained through the spatialBounds property.
