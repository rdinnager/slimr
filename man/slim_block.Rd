slim_block(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{A list of arguments corresponding to elements in SLiM code blocks.

A slimr_block object. This is of little use outside a \code{\link{slim_script}}
function call.

\description{
\code{slim_block} sets up and Eidos event code block. See details for how to specify the arguments correctly.
}
\details{
An Eidos event is a block of Eidos code that
is executed every generation, within a generation range, to perform a desired task. The syntax of an
Eidos event declaration in \code{slimr} mimics that of the Eidos (e.g. SLiM) language itself (see SLiM manual).
It looks like this:
  \code{slim_block([id,] [start_gen, [end_gen,]], [slim_callback,] \{ ... \})}
  where [ ] specifies that the code is optional.
The minimum required is a single argument containing Eidos code. This will be run in every generation
with slim_callback \code{early()}, the default for Eidos events. You can also optionally specify an id
for the SLiM code block, which will be the first argument. This is optionally followed by a starting
generation (start_gen). If only a starting generation is specified, the event will run only in that generation. Next
comes an optional end generation (end_gen), which, if specified, will tell SLiM to run the event every generation
between start_gen and end_gen. The special value of \code{..} can be used for end_gen instead, which is shorthand for
the last generation (in other words, run the event every generation between start_gen and the last generation used else
where in the script). After end_gen is an optional callback, which corresponds to an Eidos callback. The following are
valid Eidos callbacks:
\itemize{
\item{\code{early()}}
\item{\code{late()}}
\item{\code{initialize()}}
\item{\code{fitness(mut_type_id, subpop_id)}}
\item{\code{mateChoice(subpop_id)}}
\item{\code{modifyChild(subpop_id)}}
\item{\code{recombination(subpop_id)}}
\item{\code{interaction(int_type_id, subpop_id)}}
\item{\code{reproduction(subpop_id, sex)}}
}
}
\examples{
slim_script(slim_block("s1", 1, 10000, late(), {print("Hello World!")}))
}
