Documentation for SLiM function \code{smooth}, which is a method of the SLiM
class \code{\link{SpatialMap}}.
Note that the R function is a stub, it does not do anything in R (except bring
up this documentation). It will only do
anything useful when used inside a \code{\link{slim_block}} function further
nested in a \code{\link{slim_script}}
function call, where it will be translated into valid SLiM code as part of a
full SLiM script.

Smooths (or blurs, one could say) the values of the spatial map by
convolution with a kernel. The kernel is specified with a maximum distance
maxDistance (beyond which the kernel cuts off to a value of zero), a kernel
type functionType that should be "f", "l", "e", "n", "c", or "t", and
additional parameters in the ellipsis ... that depend upon the kernel type and
further specify its shape. The target spatial map is returned, to allow easy
chaining of operations. The kernel specification is similar to that for the
setInteractionType() method of InteractionType, but omits the maximum value of
the kernel. Specifically, functionType may be "f", in which case no ellipsis
arguments should be supplied; "l", similarly with no ellipsis arguments; "e",
in which case the ellipsis should supply a numeric$ lambda (rate) parameter
for a negative exponential function; "n", in which case the ellipsis should
supply a numeric$ sigma (standard deviation) parameter for a Gaussian function;
"c", in which case the ellipsis should supply a numeric$ scale parameter for a
Cauchy distribution function; or "t", in which case the ellipsis should supply a
numeric$ degrees of freedom and a numeric$ scale parameter for a t-distribution
function. See the InteractionType class documentation for discussions of these
kernel types. Distance metrics specified to this method, such as maxDistance and
the additional kernel shape parameters, are measured in the distance scale of
the spatial map - the same distance scale in which the spatial bounds of the map
are specified. The operation is performed upon the grid values of the spatial
map; distances are internally translated into the scale of the value grid. For
non-periodic boundaries, clipping at the edge of the spatial map is done; in a
2D map with no periodic boundaries, for example, the weights of edge and corner
grid values are adjusted for their partial (one-half and one-quarter) coverage.
For periodic boundaries, the smoothing operation will automatically wrap around
based upon the assumption that the grid values at the two connected edges of the
periodic boundary have identical values (which they should, since by definition
they represent the same position in space). The density scale of the kernel
has no effect and will be normalized; this is the reason that smooth(), unlike
InteractionType, does not require specification of the maximum value of the
kernel. This normalization prevents the kernel from increasing or decreasing the
average spatial map value (apart from possible edge effects).
