Documentation for SLiM function \code{sumOfMutationsOfType}, which is a method
of the SLiM class \code{\link{Genome}}.
Note that the R function is a stub, it does not do anything in R (except bring
up this documentation). It will only do
anything useful when used inside a \code{\link{slim_block}} function further
nested in a \code{\link{slim_script}}
function call, where it will be translated into valid SLiM code as part of a
full SLiM script.

Documentation for this function can be found in the official
\href{http://benhaller.com/slim/SLiM_Manual.pdf#page=647}{SLiM manual: page
647}.

Returns the sum of the selection coefficients of all mutations that
are of the type specified by mutType, out of all of the mutations in the genome.
This is often useful in models that use a particular mutation type to represent
QTLs with additive effects; in that context, sumOfMutationsOfType() will provide
the sum of the additive effects of the QTLs for the given mutation type. This
method is provided for speed; it is much faster than the corresponding Eidos
code. Note that this method also exists on Individual, for cases in which the
sum across both genomes of an individual is desired.
