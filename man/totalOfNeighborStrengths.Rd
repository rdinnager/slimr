description.}

\item{exerterSubpop}{An object of type null or Subpopulation object. Must be
of length 1 (a singleton). The default value is \code{NULL}. See details for

Documentation for SLiM function \code{totalOfNeighborStrengths}, which is a
method of the SLiM class \code{\link{InteractionType}}.
Note that the R function is a stub, it does not do anything in R (except bring
up this documentation). It will only do
anything useful when used inside a \code{\link{slim_block}} function further
nested in a \code{\link{slim_script}}
function call, where it will be translated into valid SLiM code as part of a
full SLiM script.

Returns a vector of the total interaction strength felt by each
individual in receivers by the exerters in exerterSubpop (or, if that is
NULL, then by all individuals in the receiver's subpopulation). The receivers
parameter does not need to be a singleton; indeed, it can be a vector of
all of the individuals in a given subpopulation. All of the receivers must
belong to a single subpopulation, and all of the exerters must belong to
a single subpopulation, but those two subpopulations do not need to be
the same. The evaluate() method must have been previously called for the
receiver and exerter subpopulations, and positions saved at evaluation
time will be used. If the InteractionType is nonspatial, this method may
not be called. For one individual, this is essentially the same as calling
nearestInteractingNeighbors() with a large count so as to obtain the
complete vector of all interacting neighbors, calling strength() for each
of those interactions to get each interaction strength, and adding those
interaction strengths together with sum(). This method is much faster than
that implementation, however, since all of that work is done as a single
operation. Also, totalOfNeighborStrengths() can total up interactions for more
than one receiver in a single vectorized call. Similarly, for one individual
this is essentially the same as calling strength() to get the interaction
strengths between a receiver and all individuals in the exerter subpopulation,
and then calling sum(). Again, this method should be much faster, since this
algorithm looks only at neighbors, whereas calling strength() directly assesses
interaction strengths with all other individuals. This will make a particularly
large difference when the subpopulation size is large and the maximum distance
of the InteractionType is small. See localPopulationDensity() for a related
method that calculates the total interaction strength divided by the amount
of "interaction field" present for an individual (i.e., the integral of the
interaction function clipped to the spatial bounds of the subpopulation) to
provide an estimate of the "interaction density" felt by an individual.
