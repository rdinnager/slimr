singleton). See details for description.}

\item{userData}{An object of type string or logical. Must be of length 1 (a

\description{
Documentation for SLiM function \code{treeSeqMetadata}, which is a method of the
SLiM class \code{\link{SLiMBuiltin}}.
Note that the R function is a stub, it does not do anything in R (except bring
up this documentation). It will only do
anything useful when used inside a \code{\link{slim_block}} function further
nested in a \code{\link{slim_script}}
function call, where it will be translated into valid SLiM code as part of a
full SLiM script.

\details{
Documentation for this function can be found in the official
\href{http://benhaller.com/slim/SLiM_Manual.pdf#page=710}{SLiM manual: page
710}.

Returns a Dictionary containing top-level metadata from the .trees
(tree-sequence) file at filePath. If userData is T (the default), the top-level
metadata under the SLiM/user_metadata key is returned; this is the same metadata
that can optionally be supplied to treeSeqOutput() in its metadata parameter, so
it makes it easy to recover metadata that you attached to the tree sequence when
it was saved. If userData is F, the entire top-level metadata Dictionary object
is returned; this can be useful for examining the values of other keys under the
SLiM key (see section 26.4), or values inside the top-level dictionary itself
that might have been placed there by msprime or other software. This function
can be used to read in parameter values or other saved state (tag property
values, for example), in order to resuscitate the complete state of a simulation
that was written to a .trees file. It could be used for more esoteric purposes
too, such as to search through .trees files in a directory (with the help of
the Eidos function filesAtPath()) to find those files that satisfy some metadata
criterion.
