This directory, and subdirectories, contains a gutted version of the
GNU Scientific Library (GSL) for use within SLiM and Eidos.  The goal
is to allow this project to build without an external dependency on
the GSL, so people don't have to worry about how to install the GSL.

This distribution is based upon version 2.5 of the GSL.  The code is
mostly unmodified.  Header references have been changed from <> to "",
some #pragmas have been added to mask warnings generated by the GSL
code that look innocent, and a few other small differences exist.
Mostly, though, the code is untouched except for the fact that most
of the source files of the GSL are missing in this distribution, and
in the source files that are present, large swathes of code are often
deleted; we took only what we needed for SLiM and Eidos.

This directory includes a config.h file that was built on OS X 10.11.3
with Xcode 7.2; in different environments you might need to change the
config.h file to whatever your local config.h file would be.  To do
that, get the GSL code from GNU, and run ./configure in its directory.
That should generate a config.h file that you can copy over the version
in this directory.

The standard GNU warranty and license are included in this directory,
and apply to this distribution of the GSL.
